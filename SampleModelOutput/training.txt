EOS
to 
him 
that 
hath 
shall 
be 
given
was 
a 
truism 
of 
early 
medieval 
society
EOS
because 
lords 
owned 
large 
tracts 
of 
land 
at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
opportunities 
for 
its 
exploitation 
were 
particularly 
favourable
and 
could 
add 
to 
this 
profit 
from 
tolls 
and 
customs 
on 
increasing 
trade
they 
could 
hardly 
avoid 
a 
substantial 
increase 
in 
their 
resources 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
eleventh 
century
EOS
but 
the 
fly 
in 
the 
ointment
from 
the 
princes
' 
point 
of 
view
lay 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
their 
advantages 
were 
now 
more 
widely 
shared 
than 
they 
had 
been 
in 
the 
past
EOS
and 
in 
some 
cases
most 
strikingly 
in 
normandy
the 
landed 
gains 
of 
castellans 
had 
been 
made 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
comital 
demesne
EOS
there 
was 
thus 
a 
real 
danger
not 
of 
impoverishment
but 
of 
the 
closing 
of 
the 
gap 
between 
princes 
and 
other 
lesser 
lords
just 
at 
the 
time 
when 
display 
and 
liberality 
were 
increasingly 
important 
elements 
in 
princely 
political 
armouries
EOS
renewed 
effort 
to 
enrich 
themselves 
was 
therefore 
demanded
EOS
prima 
facie
it 
seems 
likely 
that 
princes 
joined 
with 
other 
laymen 
and 
ecclesiastics 
in 
encouraging 
the 
extensive 
forest 
clearance 
that 
characterized 
the 
french 
countryside
but 
proof 
is 
lacking
EOS
the 
famous 
letter 
from 
the 
archbishop 
of 
rheims 
to 
baldwin 
v 
of 
flanders
praising 
him 
for 
his 
activities 
in 
draining 
and 
ditching 
the 
coastal 
areas 
presumably 
after 
the 
dunkirk 
inundation 
of 
1014–42 
had 
at 
last 
subsided
is 
explicit 
evidence 
of 
an 
interest 
in 
agricultural 
expansion
EOS
and 
the 
fact 
that 
wine-growing 
developed 
markedly 
on 
lands 
much 
visited 
by 
the 
dukes 
of 
burgundy 
and 
aquitaine 
is 
perhaps 
also 
suggestive 
of 
ducal 
initiative
EOS
on 
the 
other 
hand
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
the 
duke 
of 
normandy
who 
granted 
out 
the 
larger 
part 
of 
the 
demesne 
in 
feudal 
tenures
or 
the 
count 
of 
toulouse
who 
was 
slow 
to 
consolidate 
his 
lands
was 
a 
major 
contributor 
to 
agricultural 
progress
EOS
encouragement 
of 
trade 
was 
more 
widespread
EOS
again
the 
counts 
of 
flanders 
were 
in 
the 
vanguard
with 
robert 
the 
frisian 
and 
robert 
ii 
offering 
protection 
for 
merchants 
crossing 
the 
county 
and 
their 
peace 
for 
the 
duration 
of 
fairs
EOS
but 
at 
least 
as 
important 
was 
the 
provision 
of 
coinage 
suitable 
for 
reasonably 
small 
deals 
and 
sufficiently 
abundant 
for 
merchants 
to 
be 
able 
to 
rely 
on 
the 
supply
EOS
here
normandy 
was 
outstanding
EOS
as 
early 
as 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
century
wealth 
in 
the 
county 
was 
reckoned 
in 
monetary 
terms
the 
implication 
that 
coins 
circulated 
freely 
was 
borne 
out 
when 
the 
fécamp 
treasure 
was 
discovered 
in 
1954
EOS
but 
by 
around 
1020
the 
quality 
of 
norman 
coins 
declined 
markedly 
as 
a 
concomitant 
to 
the 
rapid 
increase 
in 
quantity
EOS
here 
there 
may 
have 
been 
a 
connection 
between 
the 
temporary 
weakening 
of 
ducal 
control 
over 
minting
in 
the 
troubles 
following 
richard 
ii
's 
death
and 
the 
production 
of 
a 
currency 
useful 
for 
traders
EOS
in 
aquitaine
too
this 
connection 
seems 
likely
in 
that 
silver 
coins 
modelled 
on 
those 
of 
charles 
the 
bald 
circulated 
until 
the 
serious 
financial 
crisis 
of 
1103
brought 
on 
by 
william 
ix
's 
crusading 
expenses
then 
the 
silver 
coin 
was 
devalued
followed 
in 
1112 
by 
a 
further 
devaluation
which 
preceded 
a 
period 
of 
marked 
economic 
growth
EOS
in 
toulouse 
also
the 
steadily 
falling 
value 
of 
comital 
coins 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
century 
made 
them 
relevant 
at 
last 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
merchant 
classes
EOS
there 
was
of 
course
nothing 
disinterested 
about 
princely 
debasement
but 
in 
this 
instance
princely 
profit 
was 
consistent 
with 
mercantile 
gain
EOS
deliberate 
assistance 
to 
economic 
growth 
went 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
administrative 
reform 
aimed 
at 
channelling 
its 
profits 
firmly 
into 
princely 
treasuries
EOS
this 
policy 
indicated 
that 
princes 
were 
ceasing 
to 
regard 
their 
demesnes
those 
ragbags 
of 
rights 
and 
scattered 
pieces 
of 
land
chiefly 
as 
means 
of 
buying 
support
whether 
on 
earth 
or 
in 
heaven
and 
were 
viewing 
them 
instead 
as 
permanent 
assets
to 
be 
cultivated 
in 
a 
more 
business-like 
fashion
EOS
ironically 
the 
church
which 
had 
gained 
so 
much 
from 
the 
older 
cast 
of 
mind
was  
prominent 
in 
propagating 
the 
newer 
outlook
EOS
for 
the 
monastic 
reformers 
odilo 
of 
cluny 
and 
richard 
of 
st 
vanne 
were 
renowned 
for 
their 
consolidation 
of 
monastic 
demesnes
their 
determination 
to 
ensure 
that 
what 
had 
once 
been 
granted 
to 
their 
houses 
should 
remain 
their 
inalienable 
property
EOS
inspired 
by 
this 
objective
other 
churchmen
both 
bishops 
and 
abbots
appointed 
officials 
called 
prévôts 
for 
the 
task 
of 
collecting 
rents 
and 
dues 
from 
their 
estates
EOS
their 
examples 
were 
not 
lost 
on 
princes
eudes

blois 
employed

prévôt

EOS
these 
officials 
differed 
from 
their 
predecessors 
as 
tax- 
and 
rent-collectors
the 
vicarii 
and 
viscounts
in 
that 
they 
were 
rewarded
not 
with 
a 
beneficium 
but 
with 
a 
cut 
from 
the 
profits
EOS
initially
the 
office 
was 
often 
sold 
to 
the 
highest 
bidder
who 
would 
recoup 
his 
losses 
by 
assiduity 
in 
collecting
EOS
but 
later 
it 
became 
hereditary
EOS
the 
job 
always 
excited 
unpopularity
sometimes 
even 
danger

EOS
but 
despite 
the 
risks
for 
a 
man 
of 
ambition 
and 
determination 
the 
reward 
was 
ample
for 
a 
prévôté 
might 
bridge 
the 
gap 
between 
the 
upper 
peasantry

the 
lower 
echelons 
of 
the 
aristocracy
EOS
the 
introduction 
of 
these 
new 
officials 
on 
princely 
estates 
was 
a 
piecemeal 
affair
EOS
only 
in 
flanders
where 
the 
comital 
demesne 
was 
in 
any 
case 
a 
large 
and 
solid 
block
was 
a 
complete 
network 
of 
prévôtés 
created 
before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
century
EOS
elsewhere
their 
appearance 
depended 
on 
favourable 
opportunity
EOS
some 
princes 
did 
not 
employ 
them 
at 
all 
until 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
century
EOS
and 
where 
they 
were 
employed
their 
duties 
varied 
from 
place

fulfilled

as

even 
have

military

but 
in 
performing 
their 
tasks 
all 
both 
reflected

further 
promoted 
the 
territorialization 
of 
power 
which 
was 
so 
prominent 
a 
feature 
of 
the 
eleventh

political 
scene
EOS
husbanding 
the 
demesne 
proved 
more 
difficult

in 
flanders

appointing 
new 
officials 
to 
administer 
it
EOS
huge 
grants 
of

the

resuming 
what

once 
been 
granted

the 
middle

but 
the 
real

to

slow 
attrition

the

the

abandoned

at

the

presented

what 
is 
important 
in 
the 
episode

what 
the 
narrator 
takes 
for 
granted

when 
men 
of 
standing 
disputed
arbitration 
was 
hard 
to 
arrange

often 
immediately 
unacceptable

itself 
the 
loser 
by 
the 
judgement
even 
where 
monetary 
compensation

offered 
to 
soften 
the 
blow
EOS
this 
point 
was 
a 
truism 
for 
contemporary 
princes
EOS
in 
a 
case 
which 
occurred 
some 
time 
between 
1037

1054
the 
abbot 
of

complained 
in 
geoffrey

a 
certain 
bouchard

seized

consent

EOS
in 
the 
course

the 
hearing
bouchard 
was 
brought 
finally 
to 
admit

the 
abbot
's 
complaint 
was 
true
EOS
but 
out 
of 
pity 
for 
bouchard

poverty
geoffrey 
prevailed 
on 
the 
abbot 
to 
allow

possession

the 
mill 
for 
the 
rest

his 
life

the 
strictly 
legal 
weighing 
of 
rights

wrongs 
played 
only 
a 
subordinate 
role

the 
outcome

the 
case

strength

and 
if 
geoffrey 
chose 
to 
conciliate

aristocratic

property
he 
was 
forced

the

resort

expressed 
his 
anger

knight

killed

accepted

even 
feeble 
princes

there 
was
however
a 
technical 
difficulty 
in 
the 
path

princes
' 
courts 
were 
peripatetic
they 
had 
to 
be 
pursued 
around 
the 
countryside

geoffrey 
le 
preuil 
pursued 
fulk 
le 
réchin 
in 
1093

this 
fact 
offered 
a 
convenient 
excuse 
for 
those 
summoned 
by 
their 
lords 
as 
defendants 
in 
a 
case
EOS
in 
1100
geoffrey 
of 
vendôme 
assured 
william 
ix 
of 
aquitaine 
that 
he 
was 
trying 
to 
answer 
the 
summons 
to 
the 
ducal 
court

reached 
the 
appointed

he 
found 
william 
had 
moved 
on

this 
may 
have 
been 
the 
simple 
truth
it 
may
alternatively
have 
been 
an 
instance 
of 
the 
use 
of 
delay 
by 
an 
intelligent 
but 
reluctant 
pleader
EOS
for 
the 
great 
weakness 
of 
feudal 
jurisdiction 
lay 
in 
its 
lack 
of 
muscle 
to 
enforce 
the 
appearance 
of 
both 
parties 
in 
court
EOS
and 
this 
weakness 
was 
almost 
automatically 
exacerbated 
in 
some 
instances 
by 
the 
alternative 
of 
episcopal 
jurisdiction 
for 
infringements 
of  
the 
peace 
of 
god
this 
created 
procedural 
uncertainties 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
plaintiffs

judges
to 
delay

further 
the 
chance 
of 
obtaining 
justice
EOS

these

transcended

their 
peasants 
with 
remorseless 
vigour
EOS
princes 
derived 
profit 
solely 
from 
the 
courts 
on 
their 
own 
manorial

from

an 
authentic

the 
time

fulk 
nerra

geoffrey

the 
charter 
provides 
evidence

a 
surprisingly 
well-worked-out 
system

his

the

heavy

their

the

presupposes 
a 
direct 
connection

the 
fully 
mounted

the 
fief

is 
unusually 
specific 
for 
a 
period

early

indicative

well-developed 
feudal

in

EOS
the 
drawback 
to 
feudal

from

point 
of

was 
its 
limited 
duration
EOS
the 
charter 
does 
not 
mention 
this

the 
period 
may 
still 
have 
been 
imprecise

it 
is 
not 
likely 
to 
have 
been 
above 
two

considerably
EOS
as 
a 
consequence
feudal 
contracts 
in 
the 
full 
sense 
of 
the 
term 
must 
have 
been 
more 
important 
for 
supplying 
castle-guard 
than 
for 
campaigning 
though 
it 
would 
be 
pushing 
the 
argument 
too 
far 
to 
deny 
them 
any 
significance 
in 
the 
field

the

200 
knights 
and 
1,000 
footsoldiers
EOS
though 
the 
figures 
may 
well 
be 
inaccurate
they 
attest 
the 
contemporary 
impression 
that 
even 
local 
forces 
could 
be 
very 
large
at 
least 
in 
time 
of 
emergency
EOS
how 
many 
of 
the 
200 
knights 
should 
be 
counted 
as 
members 
of 
lisiard 
of 
amboise
's 
household 
can
not 
be 
determined
the 
number 
is 
rather 
more 
what 
one 
might 
expect 
of 
the 
household 
of 
a 
great 
prince
EOS

some 
of 
them

his

hope

be 
rewarded

others 
may 
possibly 
have 
enjoyed 
what

its

others 
again

his 
emergency
a 
battle 
with 
thibaud

blois
EOS
the 
large 
number

either 
that 
they 
were 
mercenaries

that 
their

was 
accounted 
for 
by 
a 
surviving

supported

EOS
when 
the

one

solid 
grounds

even 
territorial

an 
expedition

notable

such

rely

in 
these

the

well 
be 
surrounded

owed 
him 
military 
service

they

feudal

EOS
a 
notable 
innovation 
in 
the 
eleventh-century 
diplomatic 
vocabulary 
of 
the 
north 
was 
the 
occasional 
use 
of 
the 
term 
fevum 
a 
fief
EOS
its 
late 
appearance 
was 
inexplicable 
to 
the 
older 
school 
of 
historians

regarded 
fiefs 
as 
characteristic 
of 
social 
organization 
throughout 
the 
ninth 
to 
the  
thirteenth 
centuries
EOS
nowadays 
its 
appearance 
constitutes 
a 
convincing 
argument 
for 
those 
who 
believe 
that 
fiefs 
and 
vassalage 
were 
insignificant 
in 
aristocratic 
society 
before 
about 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
the 
eleventh 
century
EOS
but 
although 
the 
use 
of 
the 
new 
word 
probably 
does 
imply 
the 
growing 
importance 
of 
a 
hitherto 
minor 
institution
it 
may 
also 
reflect 
an 
intellectual 
change
a 
dawning 
awareness 
of 
the 
need 
for 
greater 
clarity 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
feudal 
relations
EOS
a 
famous 
letter 
written 
by 
fulbert

rehearsed 
the 
duties 
of 
the 
vassal 
in 
terms 
deliberately 
chosen 
to 
be 
easily 
remembered 
by 
the 
warriors

it 
was 
to 
be 
read
EOS
fulbert
's 
application 
of 
ideas 
drawn 
directly 
from 
two 
ancient 
manuals 
of 
rhetoric
the 
ad 
herennium 
and 
cicero
's 
de 
inventione 
to 
an 
entirely 
medieval 
social 
institution

a 
vivid 
illustration

the 
way 
in 
which 
churchmen 
moulded 
the 
ethical 
perceptions 
of 
the 
military 
classes
EOS
in 
the 
letter
fulbert 
used 
the 
words 
fidelis 
and 
vassus 
interchangeably
a 
vassal 
was 
one 
who 
had 
sworn 
fidelity 
and 
who 
enjoyed 
a 
fief
EOS
but 
there 
are 
signs 
that 
not 
all 
his 
contemporaries 
saw 
the 
relationship 
in 
such 
simple 
terms
EOS
indeed
the 
cause 
of 
duke 
william
's 
concern 
on 
the 
matter 
was 
his 
clash 
with 
hugh 
iv 
de 
lusignan

the 
course 
of 
this 
hugh
embittered 
by 
william
's 
failure 
to 
keep 
his 
word
renounced 
his 
oath 
of 
fidelity
except 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
count
's  
physical 
safety 
and 
the 
safety 
of 
poitiers 
were 
concerned
EOS
his 
words 
implied 
that 
there 
were 
two 
grades 
of 
fidelity
one 
which 
obliged 
a 
fidelis 
to 
promote 
his 
lord
's 
interests 
in 
all 
things
and 
another 
that 
simply 
bound 
him 
not 
to 
injure 
him
EOS
there 
was 
logic 
in 
this 
distinction
for 
if 
the 
duties 
of 
a 
vassal 
were 
such 
as 
fulbert 
defined 
them
then 
in 
fulfilling 
them 
the 
fidelis 
whose 
estates 
were 
close 
to 
those 
of 
his 
lord 
would 
have 
to 
make 
many 
sacrifices
while 
for 
one 
who 
lived 
several 
days
' 
journey 
away
not 
making 
a 
nuisance 
of 
himself 
would 
be 
a 
relatively 
painless 
matter

differences 
in 
perception 
of 
feudal 
obligation 
were 
partly 
a 
matter

simple

there 
were

at

two 
models 
of 
knightly 
service

the

the 
point 
being

here

that 
william

superiority

all 
herbert

it 
was 
no

personal

the

might

the 
castellans

here 
the

in 
their 
superiority

collect 
comital 
dues

by  
taking

the

the 
conditional 
nature 
of 
his 
tenure
EOS

any 
weakening

the

if

universal

only

for 
the 
most 
part
later

contrived

convert 
their

into 
little 
more 
than 
a 
symbol

deference

perform

perhaps 
ironically
one 
important

rollo

normandy

purely 
in 
gratitude

EOS
a 
less 
elevated 
but 
similar 
claim 
was 
made 
by 
eudes 
ii 
in 
a 
letter 
written 
to

it

a 
question

that

does 
not 
come

to

EOS
the  
fact 
that 
the

raymond

the

be 
disputes 
among

death

on 
that 
occasion 
the 
energetic 
opposition 
to 
henry 
i

accession 
put 
up 
by 
constance

her

a 
serious 
crisis
in 
the

henry

driven 
to 
take 
refuge 
at 
the 
court 
of 
the 
duke 
of 
normandy

though 
in 
the 
end 
his 
rights 
prevailed
the

had 
long 
repercussions 
on 
his 
control 
over 
the 
counts

castellans 
of 
the 
demesne
EOS
so 
primogeniture 
was 
not 
automatically 
accepted

where 
it 
was
it 
could 
create 
problems

a 
rather 
different

over-ambitious

against 
their 
fathers 
in 
an 
attempt 
to 
establish 
their 
own 
dominion  
ahead 
of 
time
more 
problematically
princes 
had 
the 
headache 
of 
finding 
adequate 
endowments 
for 
their 
younger 
sons 
without 
infringing 
on 
the 
patrimony
EOS
but 
despite 
its 
drawbacks
primogeniture 
did 
offer 
a 
rule 
of 
thumb 
that 
commanded 
widespread 
respect
EOS
so 
the 
real 
difficulty 
remained 
in 
families 
where 
there 
was 
no 
direct 
heir
as 
the 
angevin 
succession 
crisis 
of 
the 
1060s 
proved
EOS
perhaps 
a 
mature 
perception 
of 
this 
fact 
lay 
behind 
the 
rather 
surprising 
acquiescence 
of 
most 
norman 
lords

william 
the 
conqueror

succession

he 
was

a 
child

the 
uniqueness 
of 
this 
step 
was 
long 
remembered
EOS
as 
late 
as 
the 
1180s

it

that

it

princely

fulk 
le

have 
also 
been 
available 
to 
some 
of 
those

were 
brought 
up 
with

EOS
so 
eleventh-century 
courts 
were 
centres 
for 
ceremony
business
education
charlemagne

have 
sympathized 
with 
all 
of 
these
EOS
he 
would 
have 
understood
too
the 
presence 
at 
norman

angevin 
courts 
of 
clerks

function 
it 
was 
to 
extol 
the 
deeds 
of 
their 
princes
EOS
but
despite 
einhard

assertion 
that 
he 
loved 
barbarian 
poems
he 
would 
surely 
have 
been 
disconcerted 
by 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
poitevin 
court 
under 
william 
ix 
as 
a 
centre 
of 
troubadour 
poetry
its 
prince 
as 
the 
most 
distinguished 
poet 
of 
all
EOS
and 
he 
might 
well 
have 
dismissed 
the 
flemish 
court
with 
its 
prince

hedged 
and 
ditched
its 
chancellor

audited 
accounts
as 
mercenary
EOS
what 
must 
have 
surprised 
him
as 
it 
still 
surprises 
us
was 
the 
sheer 
variety 
of 
court 
life
its 
different 
rhythms
its 
stately 
ceremonial 
in 
buildings 
still 
primitive 
both 
by 
carolingian 
and 
later 
standards
and 
the 
unique 
character 
bestowed 
on 
each 
court 
by 
the 
personality 
of 
its 
prince
EOS
sources 
1108–1180
EOS
in 
the 
twelfth 
century

blossomed
EOS
once 
an 
élite

almost 
the 
exclusive 
prerogative 
of

it 
now 
spread

the 
swelling

their

speak 
for

in

that

can 
sometimes 
be 
deceptive

the 
restored 
classical

lurk 
more 
of 
the 
earlier 
aristocratic 
assumptions

would 
have 
been 
conceded 
by 
most 
nineteenth-century

if 
anthropological 
interpretations 
become 
less 
useful
there 
is 
still 
danger 
in 
pushing 
narrowly 
juridical 
ones
EOS
but 
it 
must 
be 
said 
that 
the 
historian
's 
task 
is 
substantially 
simplified 
by 
the 
transformation
EOS
therefore 
the 
point 
of 
this 
section 
is 
only 
to 
draw 
attention 
to 
some 
aspects 
of 
intellectual 
and 
administrative 
change 
that 
can 
be 
more 
easily 
observed 
in 
a 
discussion 
on 
sources 
than 
in 
a 
more 
general 
context
EOS
few 
literary 
sources 
are 
more 
revealing 
of 
aristocratic 
culture 
than 
the 
gesta 
consulum 
andegavorum 
and 
its 
off 
shoot 
the 
gesta 
ambaziensium 
dominorum 
produced 
in 
the 
touraine 
in 
the 
first 
six 
decades 
of 
the 
twelfth 
century
for 
the 
pleasure 
and 
edification 
of 
the 
counts 
of 
anjou 
and 
their 
castellans
the 
lords 
of 
amboise
EOS
the 
skeleton 
of 
the 
gesta 
consulum 
andegavorum 
lay 
in 
a 
set 
of 
genealogies 
less 
reliable 
and 
less 
complete 
than 
those 
found 
at 
st 
aubin
's 
in 
angers 
under 
fulk 
le 
réchin
EOS
these 
may 
originally 
have 
been 
compiled 
by 
a 
touraine 
monastic 
house 
so 
that 
the 
new 
rulers 
of 
the 
area 
could 
be 
commemorated 
in 
its 
prayers
but 
like 
the 
genealogies 
of 
the 
comital 
house 
of 
flanders
they 
were 
soon 
adapted 
to 
a 
more 
secular 
purpose
EOS
around 
1109 
on 
the 
death 
of 
fulk 
le 
réchin
a 
monk
perhaps 
the 
abbot 
eudes 
of 
the 
great 
house 
of 
marmoutier
produced 
the 
first 
version 
of 
the 
gesta 
a 
series 
of 
brief 
biographies 
of 
the 
counts
EOS
the 
literary 
form 
he 
followed 
derived 
from 
the 
liber 
pontificalis 
that 
famous 
compilation 
of 
papal 
lives 
produced 
in 
rome 
at 
the 
end 
of 
every 
pontificate 
by 
the 
pope
's 
own 
clerks
especially 
in 
west 
francia 
it 
had 
been 
adopted 
in 
the 
tenth 
and 
eleventh 
centuries 
as 
a 
model 
for 
the 
history 
of 
dioceses 
e.g. 
the 
deeds 
of 
the 
bishops 
of 
auxerre
EOS
and 
it 
now 
provided 
a 
convenient 
framework 
for 
the 
praise 
of 
a 
comital 
lineage
EOS
the 
author 
set 
the 
context 
for 
his 
story 
with 
a 
lengthy 
but 
fairly 
conventional 
genealogy 
of 
the 
kings 
of 
france
tracing 
their 
origins 
back 
to 
the 
trojans 
as 
frankish 
historians 
had 
done 
since 
merovingian 
times
EOS
this 
blend 
of 
old-testament-inspired 
genealogy 
with 
legendary 
classical 
origins 
enjoyed 
a 
new 
vogue 
in 
the 
eclectic 
learned 
circles 
of 
the 
period
EOS
a 
possible 
trojan 
link 
was 
claimed 
by 
william 
of 
jumièges 
for 
william 
the 
conqueror 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
became 
king
a 
late 
eleventh-century 
genealogy 
of 
the 
counts 
of 
boulogne 
produced 
a 
similar 
conceit
and 
genealogy 
iv 
of 
the 
counts 
of 
flanders
written 
about 
1120
made 
them 
the 
most 
important 
non-royal 
family 
to 
trace 
its 
ancestry 
back 
to 
priam
EOS
so 
a 
legend 
which 
had 
originated 
with 
the 
attempts 
of 
dark 
age 
royal 
servants 
to 
give 
their 
masters 
a 
lineage 
as 
old 
and 
distinguished 
as 
that 
of 
the 
western 
roman 
emperors 
they 
had 
displaced 
continued 
in 
the 
twelfth 
century 
to 
satisfy 
the 
needs 
of 
new 
royal 
families 
and 
even 
of 
some 
princely 
houses
EOS
in 
the 
gesta 
this 
genealogy 
creates 
a 
sharp 
contrast 
between 
the 
kings 
and 
the 
counts 
of 
anjou
whose 
origins 
are 
said 
to 
lie 
in 
a 
new 
man
a 
forester 
of 
the 
reign 
of 
charles 
the 
bald
EOS
at 
first
the 
choice 
of 
such 
a 
humble 
beginning 
is 
puzzling
especially 
since 
werner 
believes 
that 
the 
angevin 
comital 
family 
was 
of 
the 
old 
carolingian 
aristocracy
with 
connections 
by 
marriage 
into 
an 
italian 
royal 
family
EOS
but 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
fulk 
le 
réchin
's 
history 
that 
the 
counts 
themselves 
knew 
nothing 
of 
their 
ancestry 
before 
the 
time 
of  
ingelgerus
fulk 
the 
red
's 
father
an 
indication 
of 
the 
block 
that 
earlier
looser 
kinship 
ties 
created 
in 
human 
memory
EOS
besides
the 
author 
of 
the 
gesta 
like 
his 
predecessor 
who 
had 
produced 
the 
second 
genealogy 
of 
the 
counts 
of 
flanders 
was 
heavily 
imbued 
with 
sallustian 
learning
EOS
if 
he 
could 
not 
posit 
an 
ancient 
line 
for 
his 
comital 
family
then 
he 
would 
choose 
to 
emphasize 
its 
newness
its 
local 
roots
its 
dependence 
on 
heroic 
deeds 
for 
its 
rise
EOS
for 
it 
was 
possible
on 
a 
reading 
of 
marius
' 
contio 
in 
sallust
to 
associate 
the 
old 
nobility 
with 
inertia
the 
new 
with 
virtue
EOS
the 
choice 
of 
a 
forester 
also 
made 
by 
the 
author 
of 
a 
thirteenth-century 
flemish 
genealogy 
is 
interesting
the 
word 
itself 
was 
a 
new 
one
having 
no 
classical 
or 
late-antique 
latin 
form
perhaps 
its 
associations 
with 
hunting 
and 
riding 
made 
it 
particularly 
appropriate 
for 
a 
family 
renowned 
for 
its 
martial 
skills
EOS
from 
the 
author
's 
point 
of 
view
its 
humble 
status 
highlighted 
the 
outstanding 
achievements 
of 
the 
individual 
counts 
in 
each 
generation 
of 
the 
family
's 
history
EOS
so 
though 
modem 
research 
has 
tended 
to 
discredit 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
medieval 
aristocracy 
of 
service
to 
insist 
on 
blue 
blood 
for 
the 
great 
lines 
of 
the 
tenth 
and 
eleventh 
centuries
and 
to 
see 
in 
the 
later 
eleventh 
and 
the 
twelfth 
centuries 
an 
ever-sharper 
patrilineal 
descent 
obliterating 
other 
considerations 
in 
family 
history
it 
should 
not 
be 
forgotten 
that 
at 
least 
one 
great 
princely 
house 
was 
encouraged 
to 
view 
its 
progress 
in 
quite 
other 
terms
EOS
what 
made 
them 
lords 
were 
their 
noble 
deeds
EOS
the 
clearest 
proof 
of 
this 
comes 
in 
the 
gesta
's 
treatment 
of 
geoffrey 
grisegonelle
fulk 
nerra
's 
father
EOS
whereas
in 
fulk 
le 
réchin
's 
account 
which 
preserved 
the 
comital 
family
's 
own 
early 
tradition
geoffrey 
was 
a 
solid 
but 
unremarkable 
figure
in 
the 
gesta 
he 
has 
undergone 
transmogrification
EOS
he 
is 
a 
chivalric 
hero
a 
mighty 
slayer 
of 
the 
danes
a 
triumpher 
in 
single 
combat
a 
victor 
over 
the 
invading 
german 
hordes
EOS
halphen
who 
edited 
the 
text
believed 
that 
here 
the 
author 
was 
drawing 
on 
a 
vernacular 
epic
this 
may 
well 
have 
been 
so
for 
in 
the 
late 
eleventh-century 
manuscript 
of 
the 
song 
of 
roland 
geoffrey 
featured 
as 
charlemagne
's 
standard-bearer
EOS
he 
had 
become 
a 
figure 
of 
legend
EOS
his 
appearance 
in 
his 
new 
guise 
in 
the 
gesta 
pinpoints 
the 
process 
by 
which 
the 
house 
of 
anjou 
built 
up 
its 
own 
chivalric 
myth
EOS
apart 
from 
fulk 
le 
réchin
the 
other 
counts 
of 
anjou 
are 
portrayed 
albeit 
less 
colourfully 
than 
geoffrey 
grisegonelle
as 
pious 
and 
valiant 
defenders 
of 
their 
inheritance
EOS
fulk
however
comes 
in 
for 
stern 
criticism
EOS
indeed 
the 
aim 
of 
the 
work 
was 
to 
demonstrate 
how 
far 
he 
had 
fallen 
from 
ancestral 
glories
in 
order 
that 
his 
successors 
might 
rectify 
his 
errors
EOS
the 
earliest 
version 
of 
the 
gesta 
finished 
just 
after 
fulk
's 
death 
in 
1109
was 
a 
stern 
warning 
to 
the 
young 
fulk 
v.
EOS
but 
the 
story 
of 
the 
gesta 
did 
not 
end 
in 
1109. 
just 
as 
later 
monks 
came 
back 
to 
the 
flemish 
comital 
genealogies 
to 
keep 
them 
up 
to 
date 
and 
to 
add 
new 
material
so 
the 
gesta 
attracted 
amplification
EOS
the 
first 
to 
turn 
his 
hand 
to 
the 
task 
was 
thomas 
de 
loches
chaplain 
and 
chancellor 
to 
fulk 
v 
and 
geoffrey 
le 
bel
EOS
the 
significance 
of 
his 
additions 
lies 
largely 
in 
the 
proof 
they 
provide 
that 
a 
touraine 
monastic 
source 
was 
the 
subject 
of 
study 
within 
the 
count
's 
own 
household 
by 
a 
secular 
clerk 
of 
distinction
EOS
his 
successor 
breton 
d'amboise
's 
version 
was 
more 
influential 
in 
that 
it 
provided 
the 
base 
for 
three 
other 
amplifications
one 
anonymous
the 
other 
two 
by 
john 
of 
marmoutier
EOS
of 
the 
latter
one 
was 
dedicated 
to 
king 
henry 
ii 
of 
england 
in 
a 
prologue 
taken 
almost 
word 
for 
word 
from 
bede
's 
preface 
to 
ceolwulf 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
ecclesiastical 
history 
of 
the 
english 
people 
EOS
there 
could 
hardly 
be 
a 
more 
appropriate 
blending 
of 
henry 
ii
's 
traditional 
angevin 
and 
new 
english 
cultural 
backgrounds
EOS
each 
of 
the 
later 
authors 
added 
to 
the 
legendary 
element 
in 
the 
gesta 
EOS
the 
figure 
whose 
character 
achieved 
clearest 
focus 
was 
that 
of 
fulk 
the 
good
geoffrey 
grisegonelle
's 
father
EOS
plagiarizing 
from 
the 
miracles 
of 
st 
martin 
at 
tours 
breton 
produced 
material 
to 
turn 
fulk 
into 
the 
conventional 
saintly 
layman 
who
assisting 
a 
leper
found 
that 
he 
had 
helped 
christ
EOS
it 
was 
recorded 
of 
him 
that 
he 
sang 
with 
the 
monks 
in 
the 
divine 
offices
when 
taunted 
by 
the 
king 
for 
his 
clerkly 
tastes
he 
responded 
that 
an 
illiterate 
king 
was 
a 
crowned 
ass 
a 
cliché 
much 
favoured 
in 
twelfth-century 
angevin 
circles
for 
it 
sprang 
from 
a 
sense 
of 
family 
superiority 
the 
counts 
of 
anjou 
were
by 
any 
standards
learned 
men
EOS
so 
fulk 
joined 
geoffrey 
as 
an 
alternative 
model 
of 
the 
perfect 
layman
EOS
as 
well 
as 
adding 
to 
the 
old 
part 
of 
the 
story
the 
continuators 
brought 
it 
up 
to 
date 
till 
the 
death 
of 
geoffrey

occasionally 
slipping 
into 
detailed 
narrative 
of 
events
there 
is 
a 
long 
and 
useful 
excursus 
on 
the 
politics 
of 
1118
EOS
the 
original 
epic 
style 
was 
maintained 
for 
the 
description 
of 
fulk 
v
's 
jerusalem 
journey 
and 
his 
coronation 
as 
king 
of 
jerusalem 
in 
1131
which 
was 
portrayed 
as 
the 
fulfilment 
of 
the 
family 
destiny
the 
union 
of 
its 
chivalric 
and 
pious 
traditions
EOS
all 
in 
all 
the 
gesta 
provided 
a 
somewhat 
daunting 
set 
of 
exemplars 
for 
king 
henry 
ii
EOS
his 
ancestors 
were 
formidable 
men
EOS
and 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
their 
portraits 
were 
largely 
drawn 
by 
monks 
they 
were 
men 
in 
a 
distinctively 
lay 
tradition

yearning 
for 
the 
cloister

they 
might 
put 
their

they 
wielded 
it 
just 
as 
often 
for 
secular 
purposes

their

EOS
its 
author
perhaps 
a 
canon

death

castellan

it 
is 
an 
unusually 
vivid 
piece

EOS
the 
feoda 
campanie 
of

shows 
originality 
of 
a 
different 
order
EOS
it 
was 
compiled 
for 
count 
henry 
the 
liberal  
of 
champagne
by 
clerks 
of 
tidy 
but 
innovative 
mind
alert 
to 
the 
political 
potential 
in 
acquiring
recording 
and 
categorizing 
information
EOS
they 
set 
out 
to 
discover 
the 
names

fiefs 
of 
all 
lords

resident 
within

county
their 
liege 
lords
and 
the 
services 
each 
owed 
to 
the 
count
EOS
the 
means 
employed 
was 
the 
sworn 
inquest
the 
ancient 
carolingian 
legal 
procedure 
for 
establishing 
the 
facts 
of 
a 
case 
by 
procuring 
statements 
on 
oath
EOS
although 
this 
procedure 
had 
been 
used 
for 
administrative 
purposes 
in 
normandy 
where 
the 
english 
example 
of 
domesday 
book 
was 
an 
inspiration
and 
in 
anjou 
before 
geoffrey 
le 
bel
's 
conquest 
of 
normandy
the 
feoda 
marked 
an 
important 
step 
in 
its 
use 
in 
eastern 
france
EOS
when 
the 
sworn 
statements 
were 
collected 
and 
sorted
the 
results 
were 
set 
out 
in 
a 
list 
preserved 
in 
the 
count
's 
treasury 
at 
st 
etienne 
in 
troyes
EOS
until 
1190
they 
were 
kept 
up-to-date
but 
in 
that 
year
count 
henry 
ii 
of 
champagne 
took 
one 
copy 
of 
the 
list 
with 
him 
when 
he 
set 
out 
for 
outremer
and 
this 
may 
have 
inhibited 
his 
officials 
from 
making 
further 
changes 
in 
the 
copy 
left 
behind 
at 
troyes
EOS
nevertheless
the 
document 
was 
still 
consulted 
in 
the 
early 
thirteenth 
century
which 
shows 
that 
it 
was 
regarded 
as 
an 
important 
statement 
of 
custom
EOS
in 
committing 
the 
count
's 
rights 
to 
written 
record
henry
's 
clerks 
had 
conferred 
on 
them 
new 
authority
EOS
the 
feoda 
contains 
the 
names 
of 
around 
1,900 
lords 
and 
knights
ranging 
from 
substantial 
aristocrats 
to 
landless 
warriors
grouped 
under 
the 
headings 
of 
the 
twenty-six 
castellanies 
of 
champagne
EOS
the 
grouping 
demonstrates 
henry
's 
clerks
' 
clear 
conception 
of 
the 
administrative 
geography 
of 
the 
county
EOS
on 
the 
other 
hand
the 
fact 
that 
some 
lords 
and 
knights 
are 
double-listed 
suggests 
doubt 
as 
to 
their 
rightful 
position
EOS
it 
seems 
likely
therefore
that 
in 
the 
process 
of 
drawing 
up 
the 
feoda 
as 
clerks 
and 
local 
lords 
decided 
under 
which 
heading 
most 
fief-holders 
should 
appear
they 
helped 
to 
crystallize 
the 
castellanies
EOS
and 
if 
the 
process 
of 
inquest 
clarified 
internal 
boundaries
it 
almost 
certainly 
also 
compelled 
fief-holders 
to 
reflect 
on 
the 
extent 
of 
the 
services 
they 
owed 
to 
the 
count
EOS
henry
's 
clerks 
had 
perceived 
the 
important 
truth 
that 
asking 
the 
right 
questions 
was 
the 
path 
to 
consolidating 
gains
EOS
all 
respondents  
acknowledged 
they 
owed 
service 
in 
times 
of 
war
rather 
less 
than 
half 
were 
obliged 
to 
provide 
regular 
castle-guard
EOS
the 
figures 
were 
high 
for 
a 
county 
in 
which 
comital 
lordship 
had 
not 
been 
noticeably 
demanding
the 
count
's 
fortifications 
should 
have 
been 
adequately 
defended
EOS
there 
was 
a 
correlation 
between 
those 
who 
owed 
castle-guard 
and 
those 
who 
recognized 
the 
count 
as 
their 
liege 
lord
again 
rather 
less 
than 
half 
the 
total
EOS
thirteenth-century 
inquests 
were 
to 
see 
a 
substantial 
increase 
in 
this 
percentage
EOS
but 
if 
comital 
liegelordship 
that 
superior 
bond 
to 
which 
all 
lesser 
allegiances 
must
in 
case 
of 
conflict
yield
was 
less 
advanced 
in 
champagne 
than 
in 
normandy 
or 
flanders
it 
completely 
outclassed 
that 
of 
any 
other 
secular 
or 
ecclesiastical 
lord 
within 
the 
county
EOS
the 
feoda 
therefore 
provides 
a 
revealing 
glimpse 
of 
aristocratic 
society 
in 
champagne
its 
full 
potential 
as 
a 
source 
has 
recently 
been 
exploited 
by 
evergates
EOS
just 
as 
significantly
it 
betrays 
henry 
the 
liberal
's 
view 
of 
feudalism 
as 
a 
clearly 
defined 
contract 
in 
which 
the 
holder 
of 
a 
specified 
fief 
of 
land 
performed 
a 
set 
amount 
of 
military 
service 
for 
the 
privilege
and
in 
cases 
where 
he 
had 
fiefs 
of 
several 
lords
had 
the 
obligation 
to 
recognize 
one 
homage 
as 
overriding
EOS
this 
view 
later 
to 
be 
the 
standard 
one 
among 
feudal 
lawyers 
was 
not 
one 
which 
earlier 
counts 
of 
champagne 
had 
embraced
EOS
their 
own 
very 
complicated 
feudal 
position 
had 
been 
an 
inhibiting 
factor
EOS
it 
may 
be 
that 
henry 
had 
to 
dispense 
largess 
to 
make 
it 
acceptable 
to 
his 
lords
but 
the 
feoda 
is 
evidence 
that 
he 
had 
somehow 
overcome 
potential 
opposition
and 
could 
now 
capitalize 
on 
his 
position 
at 
the 
apex 
of 
the 
feudal 
pyramid 
in 
the 
county
EOS
the 
feoda
's 
apparently 
innovative 
character 
makes 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
was 
produced 
in 
the 
same 
year 
as 
the 
norman 
inquest 
into 
knights
' 
fees 
seem 
more 
than 
simply 
coincidental
EOS
robert 
of 
torigny 
described 
the 
norman 
proceedings 
thus
EOS
the 
norman 
and 
champagne 
processes 
were 
not 
identical
EOS
but 
they 
were 
similar 
enough 
in 
method 
and 
assumption 
to 
suggest 
possible 
cross-fertilization
EOS
the 
new 
bureaucrats 
may 
well 
have 
been 
willing 
to 
learn 
lessons 
from 
their 
fellows 
across 
the 
boundaries 
of 
principalities
EOS
if 
so
they 
were 
preparing 
the 
path 
for 
the 
closer 
integration 
of 
french 
provinces 
achieved 
in 
the 
thirteenth 
century
EOS
finally
a 
short 
comment 
on 
charters 
as 
sources 
for 
twelfth-century 
history
EOS
the 
most 
notable 
fact 
is 
their 
proliferation 
everywhere 
across 
the 
country
EOS
their 
chances 
of 
survival 
were 
increased 
by 
the 
creation 
of 
new 
archives 
monastic 
cartularies 
became 
common
lay 
lords
notably 
the 
dukes 
of 
burgundy 
and 
the 
lords 
of 
montpellier
began 
to 
preserve 
their 
letters
EOS
but 
much 
more 
importantly
there 
were 
new 
incentives 
to 
have 
grants 
or 
judgements 
enshrined 
in 
writing
EOS
confidence 
in 
the 
written 
word
noticeably 
low 
in 
the 
eleventh 
century
increased 
everywhere
EOS
this 
reflected 
important 
social 
changes
EOS
earlier
in 
a 
small
strongly 
aristocratic 
society
where 
all 
those 
likely 
to 
resort 
to 
legal 
process 
were 
well 
known 
to 
their 
fellows
reliance 
on 
verbal 
contract 
before 
witnesses 
had 
proved 
a 
sound 
policy
allowing 
for 
future 
elasticity 
of 
interpretation 
within 
clearly-defined 
limits
EOS
now
with 
rising 
population
greater 
social 
mobility
and 
wider 
resort 
to 
legal 
processes
human 
memory 
ceased 
to 
be 
an 
effective 
guarantee 
of 
human 
contract
EOS
as 
geoffrey 
le 
bel 
said 
in 
the 
preamble 
to 
one 
of 
his 
charters
whatever 
happens 
at 
one 
point 
of 
time 
will 
scarcely 
ever 
reach 
the 
next 
generation 
in 
a 
reliable 
and 
true 
account 
unless 
it 
is 
committed 
to 
writing
EOS
this 
was 
particularly 
true 
for 
those 
small 
communities
small 
towns
or 
groups 
of 
peasants
who 
had 
won 
their 
privileges 
after 
long 
struggles 
against 
a 
higher 
authority
EOS
without 
the 
protection 
of 
a 
properly 
sealed 
and 
attested 
charter
their 
struggles 
might 
prove 
vain
since 
it 
was 
in 
nobody
's 
interest 
but 
their 
own 
that 
their 
moment 
of 
victory 
should 
be 
prolonged
EOS
there 
was
too
an 
underlying 
legal 
change
even 
though 
arbitration 
might 
still 
play 
a 
crucial 
part 
in 
their 
actual 
proceedings
courts 
gradually 
inclined 
to 
perceive 
justice 
as 
lying 
in 
precedent
or 
principle
EOS
as 
a 
result 
the 
written 
record 
of 
an 
earlier 
judgement 
given 
in 
the 
court
or 
of  
a 
grant
could 
create 
a 
prima-facie 
case 
for 
a 
favourable 
verdict
EOS
in 
one 
dispute 
at 
least
that 
between 
vierzon 
and 
st 
florent 
of 
saumur 
in 
1105
the 
judges 
seem 
to 
have 
confined 
their 
role 
to 
inspecting 
the 
documents 
provided 
by 
each 
house
before 
delivering 
their 
verdict 
in 
st 
florent
's 
favour
EOS
one 
factor 
inhibiting 
the 
spread 
of 
written 
documents 
had 
been 
fear 
of 
forgery
EOS
and 
the 
increasing 
use 
of 
charters 
in 
lawcourts 
naturally 
created 
an 
incentive 
to 
forge
as 
those 
who 
had 
lost 
or 
never 
enjoyed 
documentary 
proof 
of 
their 
rights 
strove 
to 
make 
good 
the 
deficiency
EOS
there 
was 
little 
prospect 
of 
containing 
this
EOS
what 
made 
it 
easy 
was 
that 
earlier 
charters 
had 
been 
produced 
by 
so 
many 
different 
monastic 
scriptoria 
in 
so 
many 
house 
styles 
that 
spotting 
the 
inauthentic 
was 
a 
task 
for 
the 
dedicated 
scholar 
who 
in 
any 
case 
was 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
employed 
in 
propagating 
fraud 
than 
in 
hunting 
it 
out
EOS
but 
for 
new 
grants 
or 
privileges 
the 
answer
or 
at 
least 
a 
partial 
answer
lay 
in 
insistence 
on 
proper 
confirmation 
by 
the 
legitimate 
authority
by 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
twelfth 
century
all 
charters 
produced 
across 
the 
angevin 
empire 
had 
to 
be 
confirmed 
by 
the 
angevin 
chancery
EOS
and 
better 
than 
mere 
confirmation 
was 
production
EOS
as 
princely 
chanceries 
evolved 
across 
west 
francia
their 
output 
was 
welcomed 
by 
the 
population

large

employed 
offered 
some 
assurance 
of 
authenticity
EOS
demand 
switched
from 
charters 
produced 
locally

confirmed

the 
attachment

a 
princely 
seal

written 
in 
a 
prince

in

EOS
only 
the

ancient

confident

standing

have 
dared 
to 
pen 
it
EOS
the 
appointment 
of 
a 
benedictine 
abbot 
as 
chief 
adviser 
to 
the 
king 
was 
sufficiently 
unusual 
to 
call 
to 
mind 
benedict 
of 
aniane

position 
in 
the 
early 
years 
of 
louis 
the 
pious

EOS
though 
benedict
's 
austerity 
and 
reforming 
zeal 
were 
missing 
in 
suger
his 
twelfth-century 
counterpart
there 
was 
perhaps 
a 
similar 
commitment 
to 
abstract 
political 
principle
to 
the 
notion 
of 
undivided 
imperial 
or 
royal 
power
EOS
in 
suger 
s 
case
this 
power 
was 
given 
sharper 
focus 
by 
its 
place 
at 
the 
apex 
of 
the 
terrestrial 
hierarchy
for
as 
he 
had 
learned 
from 
the 
presumed 
patron 
of 
his 
monastery
pseudo-dionysius
this 
was 
the 
proper 
ordering 
of 
earthly 
political 
authority
EOS
what 
marked 
suger 
out 
from 
other 
pseudo-dionysians 
was 
firstly
that 
he 
translated 
his 
abstractions 
into 
concepts 
directly  
relevant 
to 
french 
politics 
in 
his 
own 
time
and 
secondly 
that 
he 
proclaimed 
his 
views 
in 
the 
influential 
life 
of 
louis 
vi 
written 
in 
the 
early 
years 
of 
louis 
vii
's 
reign
EOS
as 
suger 
saw 
it
the 
french 
king 
was 
feudal 
lord 
of 
the 
princes
EOS
in 
his 
life 
he 
made 
william 
x 
of 
aquitaine 
protest 
against 
louis
's 
meddling 
in 
the 
auvergne
with 
the 
words
if 
the 
count 
of 
auvergne 
has 
committed 
any 
fault
it 
is 
my 
duty 
to 
present 
him 
at 
your 
court 
on 
your 
order
because 
he 
holds 
the 
auvergne 
of 
me 
as 
i 
hold 
it 
of 
you
EOS
behind 
these 
words 
lay 
the 
belief 
that 
all 
offices 
and 
counties 
were 
fiefs 
held 
of 
the 
king
whether 
directly 
or 
through 
an 
intermediary
EOS
here 
again 
suger 
was 
reasserting 
royal 
supremacy 
in 
a 
world 
which 
had 
long 
been 
deaf 
to 
such 
claims
EOS
he 
was 
also 
prepared 
to 
grapple 
with 
the 
practical 
consequences 
of 
his 
view
EOS
clearly 
it 
was 
illogical 
that 
the 
king
chief 
lord 
of 
all
should 
be 
vassal 
of 
any
EOS
so 
suger 
persuaded 
louis 
to 
begin 
the 
task 
not 
completed 
till 
the 
reign 
of 
philip 
augustus 
of 
extricating 
himself 
from 
the 
bonds 
of 
homage 
which 
bound 
him 
to 
various 
bishops 
in 
the 
realm
EOS
historians 
have 
considered 
this 
step 
as 
an 
essential 
preliminary 
to 
the 
later 
evolution 
of 
french 
royal 
sovereignty
EOS
but 
in 
depriving 
the 
king 
of 
any 
earthly 
lord
suger 
risked 
isolating 
him
EOS
his 
solution 
to 
this 
problem 
showed 
his 
creative 
intelligence 
at 
work
EOS
as

in

devoted 
many 
years 
to 
rebuilding 
the 
great 
abbey 
church 
in 
i 
style 
which 
was 
later 
to 
be 
hailed 
as 
the 
prototype 
of 
gothic 
architecture
to 
make 
it 
a 
fit 
royal 
mausoleum

well 
as 
a 
place

the

of 
those 
writings 
produced 
in 
fact 
by

sixth-century 
syrian 
mystic
now 
known 
as 
pseudo-dionysius
EOS
the 
most 
famous  
of 
these 
writings
that 
on 
the 
celestial 
hierarchies 
provided 
the 
abbot 
both 
with 
his 
theory 
of 
the 
function 
of 
ecclesiastical 
architecture
and 
with 
a 
means 
of 
integrating 
the 
earthly 
power 
structure 
into 
that 
of 
heaven
EOS
under 
the 
abbot
's 
influence
louis 
recognized 
st 
denis 
as 
his 
patron 
saint 
a 
traditional 
enough 
step
EOS
more 
surprisingly
he 
also 
saw 
in 
his 
patron 
a 
feudal 
lord
EOS
this 
second 
relationship 
arose 
from 
an 
ingenious 
cover-up 
to 
a 
less 
than 
wholly 
honest 
piece 
of

self-enrichment
EOS
among 
the 
lands 
earlier

to

the

a 
comital 
family

probably 
the 
advocates 
for 
the 
abbey

philip 
had 
bypassed 
their 
claims
granting 
the 
territory 
to 
the 
young 
prince 
louis
who 
met 
with 
such 
opposition 
in 
the 
area 
that 
it 
was 
not 
until 
1119 
that 
his 
possession 
was 
secured
EOS
when 
suger 
became 
abbot 
of 
st

he 
reinterpreted 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
abbey 
and 
the 
new 
count 
of 
the 
vexin
to 
the 
profit 
of 
both
EOS
louis 
became 
the 
liegeman
not 
of 
the 
abbey
but 
of 
its 
saint
EOS
in 
1124
when 
the 
king 
summoned 
the 
great 
army 
to 
meet 
the 
threat 
of

emperor 
henry

bore 
the 
standard

that

were

he 
would 
owe

to 
expand 
the 
circle

a 
regular 
objective

both 
louis

they 
recognized 
that 
a 
return 
to 
the 
carolingian 
situation
in 
which
in 
theory 
at 
least
all 
free 
men 
were 
bound 
by 
oaths 
of 
loyalty

the 
crown

an 
unrealistic 
aspiration

they 
did 
not 
even 
succeed 
in 
asserting 
their 
lordship 
over 
all 
french 
rear-vassals
on 
the 
lines 
suggested 
by 
suger
EOS
but 
they 
did 
dramatically 
increase  
the 
number 
of 
persons

groups 
of 
persons 
who 
recognized 
a 
bond 
with 
the 
crown 
through 
fidelity
EOS
their 
most 
notable 
achievement 
was 
their 
insistence 
that
for 
the 
safety 
of 
the 
church
all 
bishops 
not 
yet 
under 
the 
protection 
of 
a 
powerful 
prince

enter 
the 
king

garde 
EOS
as 
the 
bishops 
of 
clermont
le 
puy
and 
mende 
fell 
into 
this 
category
the 
massif 
central 
was 
opened 
to 
royal 
influence
EOS
then 
louis 
vi 
claimed 
the 
bishopric 
of 
arras 
for 
his 
patronage 
in 
1128 
the 
only 
gain 
from 
his 
inglorious 
intervention 
in 
the 
flemish 
succession
EOS
by 
1180
more 
than 
half 
the 
bishops 
of 
france 
were 
again 
royal 
fideles 
with 
the 
consequence 
that 
they 
sought 
royal 
justice 
against 
their 
local 
oppressors
EOS
closely 
connected 
with 
fidelity 
was 
liege 
homage
which 
the 
kings 
were 
equally 
determined 
to 
extend
EOS
louis 
vi
's 
reign 
began 
inauspiciously
with 
the 
refusal 
of 
some 
great 
princes 
to 
do 
homage
on 
the 
grounds 
that 
it 
was 
not 
customary
EOS
though 
their 
scruples 
were 
overcome
their 
objection 
pointed 
to 
their 
awareness 
that 
the 
ceremony 
was 
changing 
its 
meaning
EOS
in 
1106
after 
the 
death 
of 
his 
brother 
geoffrey
fulk 
of 
anjou 
was 
recorded 
by 
orderic 
as 
having 
received 
the 
county 
of 
anjou 
from 
king 
philip 
i
his 
homage 
therefore 
implied 
feudal 
subordination
EOS
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
century
louis 
vi 
and 
louis 
vii 
succeeded 
in 
imposing 
this 
interpretation 
on 
all 
their 
princes
' 
homage
EOS
in 
1158
for 
example
henry 
ii 
swore 
to 
louis 
vii
EOS
the 
angevin 
lands 
were 
recognized 
without 
equivocation 
as 
fiefs 
of 
the 
crown
EOS
this 
new 
precision 
allowed 
the 
king 
to 
capitalize 
on 
his 
princes
' 
territorial 
consolidation
when 
william 
x 
took 
homage
both 
aquitaine 
and 
gascony 
were 
included 
in 
the 
contract
when 
raymond 
v 
became 
louis 
vii
's 
man
the 
rouergue
gothia
and 
part 
of 
provence 
joined 
toulouse 
as 
fiefs 
of 
the 
crown 
of 
france
EOS
thus 
effortlessly 
the 
kings 
extended 
their 
realm
EOS
one 
royal 
prerogative 
never 
to 
be 
revived 
in 
its 
full 
carolingian 
glory 
was 
the 
holding 
of 
assemblies 
for 
the 
whole  
military 
aristocracy 
of 
the 
realm
EOS
ironically
this 
was 
a 
source 
of 
strength 
for 
the 
dynasty 
because
unlike 
its 
english 
counterpart
it 
did 
not 
have 
to 
face 
the 
potential 
opposition 
a 
corporate 
body 
of 
the 
great 
magnates 
could 
provide
EOS
but 
both 
kings 
did 
benefit 
from 
public 
gatherings 
of 
bishops 
and 
great 
men
largely 
though 
not 
exclusively 
from 
within 
the 
duchy 
of 
francia

the 
model 
of 
the 
assembly

i

called 
to 
orléans

1077
EOS
the 
most 
famous 
of 
these 
meetings

attended 
by

duke

the 
counts 
of 
troyes 
and 
nevers
in 
addition 
to 
the 
lords 
of 
the 
royal 
demesne 
provided 
the 
occasion 
for 
louis 
vii 
to 
come 
as 
close 
to 
legislating 
as 
any 
twelfth-century 
french 
or 
english 
king 
was 
to 
do
EOS
here 
he 
proclaimed 
the 
peace 
of 
god 
for 
the 
whole 
regnum 
realm 
an 
ambiguous 
term
which 
may 
mean 
simply 
his 
demesne
or 
the 
old 
duchy 
of 
francia
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
twentieth 
canon 
of 
the 
second 
lateran 
council 
1139
and 
established 
penalties 
for 
the 
violation 
of 
that 
peace
EOS
the 
princes 
present 
consented 
to 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
peace 
to 
their 
dominions 
though 
not 
necessarily 
in 
toto 
or 
without 
alteration
EOS
the 
action 
lacked 
that 
forceful 
superiority 
which 
had 
characterized 
carolingian 
capitularies
at 
least 
in 
the 
time 
of 
charlemagne
but 
it 
revived 
the 
tradition 
whereby 
the 
crown 
was 
seen 
as 
the 
author 
of 
society
's 
moral 
norms
EOS
a 
commoner 
function 
for 
assemblies 
was 
coordinating 
plans 
for 
war
EOS
when
in 
1124
the 
emperor 
henry 
v 
planned 
an 
invasion
louis 
summoned 
his 
nobles 
to 
rheims 
to 
debate 
tactics 
and 
draw 
up 
the 
battle-lines
EOS
along 
with 
troops 
from 
the 
royal 
demesne 
and 
from 
those 
towns 
which 
relied 
on 
royal 
protection
the 
dukes 
of 
burgundy 
and 
aquitaine
the 
counts 
of 
blois
troyes
nevers
brittany
and 
anjou
came 
in 
person 
with 
their 
men
EOS
the 
assembly 
was 
so 
formidable 
that 
henry 
v 
decided 
to 
abandon 
his 
campaign
EOS
1124 
found 
the 
french 
princes 
unusually 
united
assemblies 
to 
discuss 
wars 
against 
normandy 
could 
never 
command 
such 
support
EOS
excuses 
for 
failures 
to 
attend 
abounded
EOS
yet 
though 
irregular 
both 
in 
incidence 
and 
attendance
assemblies 
provided 
a 
golden 
opportunity 
for 
the 
dissemination 
of 
royal 
propaganda
to 
insist 
on 
the 
notion 
of 
public
war 
see 
p. 
288
and 
to 
depict 
royal 
campaigns 
as 
undertaken 
for 
the  
defence 
of 
the 
realm
rather 
than 
simply 
for 
the 
king
's 
self-interest
EOS
one 
further 
return 
to 
carolingian 
precedent 
occurred 
at 
the 
very 
end 
of 
louis 
vii
's 
reign
when 
coinage 
from 
the 
king
's 
mints 
and 
bearing 
his 
image 
began 
to 
circulate 
outside 
the 
royal 
demesne 
for 
the 
first 
time 
since 
the 
late 
ninth 
century
EOS
admittedly
its 
circulation 
in 
the 
kingdom 
was 
small
its 
rivals 
powerful
EOS
nevertheless 
it 
marked 
the 
first 
step 
though 
only 
that 
in 
the 
restoration 
of 
royal 
coinage 
inside 
west 
francia
EOS
as 
judges
louis 
vi 
and 
louis 
vii 
were 
far 
more 
impressive 
when 
operating 
inside 
the 
demesne 
see 
p. 
296
than 
when 
acting
in 
their 
royal 
capacity
beyond 
its 
frontiers
EOS
the 
difficulty 
was 
the 
standard 
feudal 
one 
of 
failing 
to 
get 
both 
parties 
to 
appear
EOS
in 
1153
for 
example
when 
the 
bishop 
of 
langres 
brought 
a 
complaint 
against 
duke 
eudes 
ii 
of 
burgundy 
in 
the 
royal 
court
all 
four 
royal 
summonses 
to 
the 
duke 
met 
with 
excuses
in 
the 
end
therefore
the 
royal 
verdict 
was 
given 
by 
default 
to 
the 
bishop
but 
without 
much 
expectation 
that 
a 
long-term 
solution 
to 
the 
conflict 
had 
been 
achieved
EOS
still
the 
case 
was 
important
because 
louis 
had 
summoned 
eudes 
for 
a 
breach 
of 
the 
peace
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
second 
lateran 
council
's 
definition
EOS
the 
crown 
was 
thus 
establishing 
its 
right
even 
before 
the 
1155 
assembly
of 
prosecuting 
violence 
beyond 
the 
frontiers 
of 
the 
demesne
EOS
and 
with 
lords 
of 
lower 
rank
the 
king 
dared 
more
EOS
as 
early 
as 
1108–9
louis 
vi 
had 
led 
a 
campaign 
into 
berry 
to 
force 
the 
lord 
of 
bourbon
's 
submission 
to 
the 
judgement 
of 
the 
royal 
court
EOS
where 
there 
was 
no 
breach 
of 
the 
peace
the 
kings 
continued 
to 
arbitrate
employing 
persuasion 
or 
pressure 
according 
to 
the 
standing 
of 
those 
involved
EOS
in 
the 
1155 
peace 
between 
king 
henry 
ii 
and 
louis 
vii
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
henry
's 
quarrel 
with 
thibaud 
of 
blois 
should 
be 
ended 
by 
arbitration
EOS
to 
increase 
the 
chances 
of 
success
louis 
offered 
henry 
two 
teams 
of 
mediators
if 
he 
did 
not 
like 
the 
methods 
or 
conclusions 
of 
the 
first 
set
he 
could 
turn 
to 
the 
second
EOS
but 
louis 
was 
prepared 
to 
take 
a 
much 
tougher 
line 
with 
the 
count 
of 
nevers 
to 
resolve 
his 
dispute 
with 
the 
abbey 
of 
vézelay
although 
relatives 
of 
the 
count 
were 
allowed 
to  
participate 
in 
drawing 
up 
the 
terms 
of 
settlement
louis 
insisted 
that
if 
it 
failed
further 
aggression 
against 
the 
abbey 
would 
be 
treated 
as 
aggression 
against 
the 
king 
and 
punished 
accordingly
EOS
the 
dispute 
could 
not 
be 
allowed 
to 
drag 
on
EOS
so 
the 
reigns 
of 
louis 
vi 
and 
his 
son 
proved 
a 
decisive 
turning-point 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
french 
monarchy
EOS
after 
three 
centuries 
of 
decline
the 
first 
steps 
had 
been 
taken 
on 
the 
path 
to 
restoration
EOS
a 
royal 
letter 
to 
the 
people 
of 
limoges 
c.1137 
ended
you 
know 
that 
those 
who 
despise 
our 
orders 
lose 
our 
favour 
and 
incur 
our 
displeasure
EOS
this 
might 
seem 
a 
rather 
feeble 
threat
EOS
but 
at 
least 
the 
people 
of 
limoges 
had 
been 
reminded 
that 
royal 
favour 
and 
displeasure 
were 
worthy 
of 
consideration
EOS
it 
is 
inevitable 
that 
the 
kingship 
of 
the 
louis 
should 
be 
discussed 
in 
terms 
of 
a 
return 
to 
the 
past
for 
this 
was 
the 
way 
they 
themselves 
justified 
it
their 
innovations 
were 
resumptions
EOS
nevertheless 
behind 
the 
traditional 
concepts 
there 
lurked 
a 
marked 
change
EOS
for 
carolingian 
royal 
rights 
had 
applied 
everywhere 
except 
where 
a 
grant 
of 
immunity 
blocked 
them
but 
capetian 
royal 
rights 
were 
respecters 
of 
strongly 
entrenched 
vested 
interests
EOS
on 
the 
other 
hand
whereas 
carolingian 
rights 
had 
been 
static
therefore 
subject 
to 
attrition
capetian 
rights 
were 
elastic
with 
skilful 
manipulation 
they 
grew
EOS
an 
example 
of 
this 
can 
be 
seen 
in 
louis 
vii
's 
second 
burgundian 
expedition
already 
mentioned
EOS
the 
occasion
in 
1171
was 
a 
complaint 
by 
the 
monastery 
of 
cluny 
against 
the 
count 
of 
mâcon
EOS
louis
's 
duty 
to 
respond 
arose 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
1119
cluny
caught 
between 
its 
need 
of 
lay 
protection 
and 
fear 
that 
the 
local 
lords 
would 
seek 
to 
violate 
its 
famous 
immunity
had 
turned 
to 
the 
distant 
but 
pious 
louis 
vi 
and 
placed 
its 
whole 
order 
in 
his 
guardianship
EOS
so 
his 
son
no 
doubt 
unwillingly
was 
compelled 
to 
mount 
an 
expedition 
to 
discipline 
the 
count
EOS
the 
king
's 
appearance 
in 
the 
mâcunnais 
revived 
ancient 
memories 
of 
louis 
iv
's 
visit 
in 
950
which 
his 
successor 
exploited 
effectively
stressing 
the 
justice 
of 
his 
cause 
and 
the 
royal 
obligation 
to 
suppress 
evil
EOS
having 
subdued 
the 
count
louis 
toured 
the 
castles
to 
remind 
castellans 
of 
the 
long-forgotten 
doctrine 
that 
fortifications 
were 
the 
monopoly 
of 
public 
authorities
EOS
but 
while 
reasserting 
the 
old
he 
also 
broke 
new  
ground 
in 
the 
claim 
that 
he 
was 
rightful 
lord 
over 
all 
men 
in 
the 
area 
who 
had 
hitherto 
had 
no 
lord
EOS
and 
for 
good 
measure
he 
entered 
into 
an 
important 
pariage 
agreement 
with 
cluny 
and 
the 
bishop 
and 
chapter 
of 
mâcon
that 
resulted 
in 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
royal 
enclave 
within 
the 
county
EOS
from 
this 
nucleus
royal 
territory 
was 
in 
the 
future 
to 
expand 
to 
the 
point 
at 
which
in 
1239
the 
whole 
county 
could 
be 
annexed 
to 
the 
royal 
demesne
EOS
in 
an 
area 
of 
weak 
lordship
louis 
was 
prepared 
to 
capitalize 
on 
a 
simple 
right 
of 
protection 
to 
claim 
an 
old 
public 
obligation
a 
new 
feudal 
lordship
and 
a 
new 
territorial 
stake
EOS
the 
innovative 
character 
of 
capetian 
kingship 
is 
unmistakable
EOS
the 
same 
point 
can 
be 
illustrated 
from 
the 
solid 
profit 
which 
was 
derived 
from 
the 
expanding 
royal 
protection 
of 
bishoprics
EOS
on 
the 
face 
of 
it
louis 
vi
's 
claim 
to 
be 
lord 
of 
all 
bishops 
not 
already 
under 
effective 
protection 
looks 
a 
modest 
attempt 
to 
regain 
only 
part 
of 
the 
carolingian 
inheritance
EOS
and 
in 
one 
sense 
so 
it 
was
for 
by 
1150 
almost 
half 
the 
bishoprics 
in 
france 
still 
escaped 
crown 
control
EOS
but 
there 
was 
nothing 
conservative 
about 
the 
way 
in 
which 
louis 
and 
his 
successor 
exploited 
the 
bishop 
of 
clermont
's 
complaints 
against 
the 
count 
of 
the 
auvergne 
to 
secure 
a 
foothold 
in 
the 
county
it 
was 
their 
preparatory 
work 
that 
made 
possible 
philip 
augustus
' 
annexation 
of 
the 
auvergne

the 
royal 
demesne
EOS
equally
louis 
vii
's 
intervention 
in 
the 
disputed 
election 
at 
langres 
in 
1138 
prepared 
the 
way 
for 
his 
charter 
of 
1179
taking 
the 
city 
and 
the 
whole 
episcopal 
fief 
under 
crown 
protection
EOS
as 
caries 
sets

at 
a 
weak 
point 
in

tooth

spreads 
to 
rot 
the 
whole

so 
an 
appeal 
to 
the 
crown 
could 
trigger 
the 
decay 
of 
local 
autonomy
EOS
a 
different 
view 
of 
royal 
opportunism 
can 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
confirmation 
of 
charters 
for 
leading 
monasteries 
outside 
the 
demesne
EOS

EOS
in 
1196
the 
dowager 
countess 
matilda
confirming 
ghent

privileges
ensured 
that 
no 
barriers 
would 
obstruct 
any 
competent 
person

wished 
to 
open 
a 
school 
in 
the

EOS
the 
church
's 
monopoly 
of 
formal 
education 
was 
broken
EOS
before 
this 
was 
achieved
where 
the 
new 
town  
governors
'

proved 
too 
feeble 
to 
cope 
with 
challenges
it 
could 
be 
supplemented 
by 
the 
skills 
of 
notaries 
like 
galbert 
of 
bruges
EOS
thus 
the 
complex 
administration 
necessary 
for 
repairing

extending 
city 
walls
channelling 
water

ejecting 
waste
hearing 
legal

all 
be 
supplied
EOS
the 
culminating 
symbol 
of 
so 
much 
diverse 
activity 
was 
to 
be 
achieved 
in 
the 
thirteenth 
century
when 
the 
independent 
cities
led 
by 
those 
of 
flanders
erected 
fine 
belfries 
so 
that 
their 
bells 
should 
rival 
those 
of 
the 
churches 
in 
summoning 
the 
flock 
to 
meet
EOS
however 
the 
movement 
for 
some 
degree 
of 
independence
some 
autonomy
was 
not 
confined 
to 
substantial 
towns
EOS
it 
is 
true 
that 
the 
privilege 
of 
smaller 
towns 
was 
generally 
couched 
in 
more 
negative 
terms
by 
defining 
their 
consuetudines 
they 
prevented 
other 
powers 
usually 
castellans 
from 
arbitrary 
exactions
EOS
yet 
very 
rapidly 
a 
list 
of 
prohibitions 
or 
limitations 
on 
the 
overlord
's 
power 
could 
become 
a 
guarantee 
of 
the 
citizens
' 
rights
EOS
in 
a 
letter 
to

robert 
of 
montfalcon 
declared 
that 
a 
case 
over 
whether 
or 
not 
a 
certain 
man 
was 
his 
serf 
should 
be 
tried 
either 
in 
the 
royal 
court 
or 
before 
the 
archbishop 
of 
bourges
provided 
that 
the 
proceedings 
were 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
customs 
of 
bourges
for 
him
the 
consuetudines 
of 
his 
native 
town 
had 
assumed 
the 
status 
of 
a 
law 
binding 
on 
outside 
authorities
EOS
bourges 
was 
a 
community 
in 
a 
vital 
sense
bound 
by 
rules 
of 
the 
inhabitants
' 
own 
making
EOS
both 
bourges 
and 
laon 
were 
wine-growing 
areas
EOS
a 
contributory 
factor 
in 
their 
campaigns 
to 
secure 
charters 
was 
that 
the 
peasants 
who 
grew 
the 
vines 
around 
the 
outskirts 
of 
the 
town 
found 
arbitrary 
and 
unpredictable 
seigneurial 
exactions 
an 
intolerable 
burden 
on 
a 
form 
of 
agriculture 
for 
which 
long-term 
planning 
was 
essential
EOS
rural 
pursuits 
as 
well 
as 
urban 
required 
the 
protection 
that 
written 
and 
confirmed 
consuetudines 
could 
bestow
EOS
in 
1155
the 
customs 
confirmed 
by 
louis 
vii 
for 
lorris 
on 
the 
royal 
demesne 
established 
that 
no 
parishioner 
should 
have 
to 
pay 
taxes 
on 
food 
intended 
for 
his 
own 
consumption 
or 
on 
grain 
grown 
by 
his 
own 
labour
he 
should 
be 
exempt 
from 
tolls 
when 
he 
took 
his 
produce 
to 
the 
neighbouring 
towns 
of 
etampes
orléans
milly
or 
melun
if 
required 
for 
a 
chevauchée 
he 
must 
be 
allowed 
to 
return  
home 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
day
the 
only 
labour 
service 
he 
owed 
his 
lord 
was 
in 
carrying 
seigneurial 
wine 
to 
orléans 
twice 
a 
year
and 
the 
burgesses 
of 
lorris 
as 
a 
whole 
were 
exempted 
from 
seigneurial 
tailles 
EOS
these 
concessions
ideally 
suited 
to 
promote 
the 
interests 
of 
an 
agricultural 
community
ensured 
widespread 
publicity 
for 
the 
customs 
of 
lorris
they 
were 
therefore 
sought 
and 
obtained 
by 
a 
number 
of 
other 
rural 
communities
particularly 
within 
the 
royal 
demesne
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
twelfth 
century
EOS
the 
appearance 
of 
privileged 
communities 
was 
not 
quite 
as 
haphazard 
as 
it 
may 
seem
EOS
where 
lordship 
was 
strong
as 
in 
paris
the 
degree 
of 
self-government 
was 
strictly 
limited
EOS
the 
same 
was 
true 
in 
normandy
where 
henry 
ii
's 
concession 
to 
rouen 
between 
1160 
and 
1170
soon 
to 
be 
a 
model 
for 
other 
cities 
across 
the 
angevin 
empire
permitted 
internal 
self-government 
by 
a 
mayor 
and 
town 
council
but 
also 
allowed 
the 
duke 
to 
choose 
the 
mayor 
from 
a 
list 
of 
three 
names 
submitted 
to 
him 
by 
the 
council
and 
protected 
the 
ducal 
right 
to 
military 
service
EOS
elsewhere
the 
degree 
of 
urban 
independence 
varied 
with 
the 
amount 
of 
pressure 
the 
community 
could 
exert
its 
ability 
to 
exploit 
political 
crisis
and 
the 
condition 
of 
its 
neighbours
EOS
the 
interplay 
of 
these 
factors 
was 
complex
the 
two 
areas 
where 
the 
most 
advanced 
urban 
institutions 
were 
found 
were 
flanders
where 
comital 
control 
was 
tight
and 
gothia
where 
by 
contrast 
the 
count 
of 
toulouse
's 
authority 
within 
the 
great 
cities 
was 
almost 
negligible
and 
where 
the 
clashes 
between 
vicecomital 
and 
episcopal 
powers 
facilitated 
independence
EOS
on 
the 
lower 
rung 
of 
legal 
self-determination 
the 
grant 
of 
customary 
franchises 
might 
be 
in 
a 
lord
's 
interests
for 
it 
could 
secure 
his 
revenues 
in 
perpetuity
even 
as 
it 
barred 
him 
the 
chance 
of 
arbitrary 
exaction
besides
an 
early 
concession 
might 
prevent 
more 
explosive 
demands 
later
EOS
some 
castellans 
and 
bishops 
were 
therefore 
amenable 
to 
bargaining
but 
others 
needed 
forceful 
persuasion
EOS
again
where 
local 
lordship 
was 
strong
above 
all 
in 
normandy
the 
chances 
of 
concessions 
were 
small
EOS
those 
communities 
which 
did 
not 
receive 
franchises 
seem 
to 
have 
suffered 
a 
greater 
degree 
of 
extortion
as 
their 
lords 
strove 
to 
recover 
some 
of 
the 
profits 
they 
were 
losing 
elsewhere
EOS
as 
a 
consequence
the 
condition  
of 
the 
peasantry 
in 
twelfth-century 
france 
varied 
markedly 
from 
community 
to 
community'
the 
extremes 
of 
contrast 
coming 
between 
those 
villages 
on 
the 
royal 
demesne 
protected 
by 
the 
customs 
of 
lorris
and 
those 
in 
champagne 
where 
serfdom 
retained 
its 
original 
rigours
where 
peasants 
remained 
the 
property 
of 
their 
lords
their 
labour 
services 
heavy
their 
safeguards 
against 
exploitative 
lordship 
non-existent
EOS
on 
a 
pragmatic 
level
the 
pressure 
for 
self-government 
or 
franchise 
complicated 
the 
aristocracy
's 
game 
of 
preserving 
their 
own 
lordship 
while 
subverting 
that 
of 
their 
rivals
EOS
it 
could 
offer 
opportunities 
for 
embarrassing 
independent 
lords
as 
alphonse 
jourdain 
of 
toulouse 
showed 
when 
he 
assisted 
the 
rebellious 
inhabitants 
of 
montpellier 
against 
william 
vi
but 
his 
own 
financial 
losses 
when 
the 
right 
to 
take 
tallage 
or 
forced 
loans 
from 
toulouse 
escaped 
his 
grasp 
in 
1147
outweighed 
any 
advantage 
elsewhere
EOS
no 
lords 
appreciated 
the 
possibilities 
inherent 
in 
the 
movement 
so 
clearly 
as 
louis 
vi 
and 
louis 
vii
EOS
their 
consummate 
skill 
in 
limiting 
demands 
for 
independence 
on 
the 
royal 
demesne
while 
favouring 
them 
elsewhere 
where 
a 
royal 
confirmation 
might 
create 
allies
has 
often 
been 
remarked
EOS
but 
the 
clearest 
example 
of 
royal 
skill 
was 
found 
in 
louis 
vii
's 
cynical 
suppression 
of 
vézelay
's 
revolt 
against 
its 
abbot 
in 
1152
EOS
the 
rebels
provoked 
by 
ponce 
of 
vézelay
's 
unyielding 
determination 
to 
maintain 
a 
monopoly 
of 
justice 
within 
the 
town
won 
much 
self-interested 
support 
in 
the 
neighbourhood
from 
the 
bishop 
of 
autun
who 
wished 
to 
subject 
the 
abbey 
to 
episcopal 
control
from 
cluny
which 
hoped 
to 
reabsorb 
the 
abbey 
into 
its 
order
and 
from 
the 
count 
of 
nevers
who 
resented 
the 
legalistic 
and 
literal 
interpretation 
the 
abbot 
put 
upon 
his 
charter 
of 
immunity
EOS
on 
the 
other 
hand 
ponce 
was 
strengthened 
in 
his 
intransigence 
by 
a 
papal 
letter 
forbidding 
him 
to 
make 
concessions 
on 
the 
immunity
EOS
but 
when 
his 
isolation 
rendered 
him 
vulnerable
he 
turned 
to 
louis 
for 
assistance
EOS
as 
a 
price 
for 
his 
reduction 
of 
the 
rebels
louis 
forced 
from 
the 
very 
reluctant 
abbot 
the 
recognition 
that 
in 
temporal 
matters 
he 
was 
subject 
to 
the 
decision 
of 
the 
royal 
court
EOS
louis
's 
behaviour 
betrayed 
no 
interest 
in 
abstract 
justice
he 
was 
prepared 
to 
force 
modifications 
of 
the  
immunity 
in 
his 
own 
favour
but 
not 
in 
those 
of 
the 
count 
of 
nevers 
or 
of 
the 
rebels
moreover
his 
opposition 
to 
the 
commune 
was 
inconsistent 
with 
his 
behaviour 
at 
rheims 
or 
amiens
and 
with 
long-term 
royal 
policy 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
century
vézelay 
had 
won 
its 
liberties
EOS
but 
in 
the 
short 
term
the 
king 
was 
the 
only 
party 
to 
the 
dispute 
who 
benefited 
by 
it
for 
it 
allowed 
him 
to 
display 
vigorous 
royal 
action 
within 
the 
county 
of 
nevers
EOS
for 
all 
princes
the 
communal 
movement 
raised 
a 
rather 
different 
problem
each 
privileged 
community
whether 
fully 
self-governing 
or 
merely 
franchised
constituted 
in 
enclave 
subject 
to 
different 
rules 
from 
its 
neighbours
it 
was 
not 
therefore 
easily 
absorbed 
into 
the 
administrative 
framework 
of 
castellanies 
which 
the 
princes 
of 
the 
north 
were 
seeking 
to 
clarify 
and 
define
EOS
indeed
towns 
were 
as 
anomalous 
as 
the 
independent 
lordships 
the 
count 
of 
champagne 
was 
bent 
on 
integrating 
into 
his 
castellan 
network
EOS
since 
what 
distinguished 
communities 
was 
their 
legal 
customs
anomalies 
could 
be 
reduced 
by 
greater 
legal 
uniformity 
within 
a 
whole 
castellany 
or
better 
still
a 
whole 
province
EOS
there 
was 
no 
problem 
in 
normandy
where
by 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
twelfth 
century
one 
customary 
law 
obtained 
virtually 
throughout 
the 
duchy
EOS
elsewhere 
in 
the 
north 
strong 
rulers
the 
kings
the 
counts 
of 
flanders 
and 
anjou
increased 
standardization 
by 
modifying 
customs 
when 
they 
confirmed 
them
or 
by 
persuading 
new 
communities 
to 
accept 
wholesale 
already 
existing 
customs
EOS
but 
though 
the 
patchwork 
of 
random 
entities 
slowly 
yielded 
in 
places 
to 
more 
solid 
blocks
nevertheless 
between 
them 
many 
separate 
customs 
survived
EOS
later 
in 
the 
middle 
ages
the 
pays

the 
land

reckoned 
to 
consist 
of 
more 
than 
three 
hundred 
different 
customs

only 
sixty 
of

developed 
differently
EOS
there 
the 
eleventh-century 
proliferation

consuetudines

been 
modified 
by 
the 
survival 
in 
places 
at 
least

the 
old 
administrative 
framework

by 
the 
tradition 
that 
serious 
offences 
were 
justiciable 
in  
a 
court 
higher 
than 
that 
of 
the 
castellan
EOS
the 
growth 
of 
independent 
towns 
in 
the 
twelfth 
century 
lent 
force 
to 
the 
revival 
of 
public 
courts 
on 
the 
carolingian 
model

mediterranean 
contacts 
ensured

warm 
welcome

the 
learning 
of 
bolognese 
roman 
lawyers 
in 
the 
early 
decades 
of 
the 
century
EOS
although 
the 
academic 
study 
of 
roman 
law 
took 
a 
long 
time 
to 
have 
practical 
effect
by 
the 
1170s

1180s 
it 
was 
occasionally 
cited 
authoritatively 
in 
some 
at

of 
the 
courts

the 
south
EOS
the 
pays

emerging

courts 
within 
its 
framework
EOS
by 
this 
means 
the 
south 
was 
to 
achieve 
a 
rather 
greater 
legal 
homogeneity

the 
north
EOS
c
the 
emergence 
of 
government
EOS
what 
distinguishes 
government 
from 
personal 
control 
is 
its 
unremitting 
character
EOS
to 
be 
governed 
is 
to 
be 
subjected 
to 
the 
regular 
pressure 
of 
an 
authority 
operating 
according 
to 
fixed 
rules
EOS
in 
the 
full 
sense 
of 
the 
word
it 
is 
arguable 
that 
nobody 
was 
governed 
before 
the 
later 
nineteenth 
century
it 
would 
certainly 
be 
foolish 
to 
maintain 
that 
either 
royal 
or 
princely 
government 
in 
the 
twelfth 
century 
operated 
according 
to 
fixed 
rules 
or 
without 
intermission 
or 
over 
all 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
a 
defined 
area
EOS
nevertheless
the 
perception 
that 
this 
might 
be 
desirable 
was 
reborn
whether 
for 
good 
or 
for 
ill
among 
the 
twelfth-century 
rulers 
of 
france
EOS
what 
provoked 
it 
was 
in 
part 
the 
ecclesiastical 
reform 
movement
EOS
for 
the 
reformers
' 
vision 
of 
a 
fully-developed 
hierarchy
each 
man 
with 
his 
own 
sphere 
of 
competence
all 
subject 
to 
canon 
law 
and 
all 
beneath 
the 
discipline 
of 
the 
papal 
rod
evoked 
a 
mixture 
of 
admiration 
and 
envy 
in 
those 
laymen
accustomed 
to 
deference
whose 
position 
in 
the 
ecclesiastical 
scheme 
was 
lower 
than 
they 
would 
have 
wished
EOS
they 
neither 
cared 
nor 
dared 
explicitly 
to 
challenge 
this 
picture
as 
the 
pro-imperialists 
among 
the 
germans 
had 
done
EOS
rather 
they 
contented 
themselves 
by 
pointing 
out 
that
if 
the 
secular 
power 
was 
now 
confined 
to 
the 
rather 
lowly 
role 
of 
protecting 
the 
church
's 
interests 
with 
the  
material 
sword
that 
sword 
was 
in

essential

the 
well-being

the 
church
EOS
so 
baldwin 
vii

flanders
confirming 
the 
privileges 
of 
zonnebeke 
abbey
declared
EOS
it 
was 
powerful 
pragmatic 
argument
EOS
but 
it 
did 
involve 
the 
acceptance

a 
spiritual 
authority 
beyond 
his 
control
to 
which 
his 
ancestor 
arnoul 
i 
could 
never 
have 
bowed
EOS
and 
those 
among

refused 
to 
recognize 
that 
authority

duke 
william

in 
returning 
to 
the

recalled 
the 
augustinian

strong
EOS

its

that

they

they 
found 
it 
easy 
to 
articulate 
rules

general 
application

which 
exceptions 
required 
specific 
dispensation
EOS

of 
course 
this 
viewpoint 
was 
liable 
to 
emerge 
in 
any 
case 
at 
a 
time 
in 
which 
government 
was 
extending 
its 
reach 
down 
the

affect 
towns
privileged

even 
on

serfs
EOS
the 
schools 
springing 
up 
all 
over 
france 
in 
the 
twelfth 
century

had 
a

EOS
at

received 
a 
licentia 
docendi 
a 
licence 
to 
teach
EOS
elsewhere
it 
is 
uncertain 
how 
many 
of 
the 
clerks 
and 
knights 
of 
princely 
households 
obtained 
from 
schools 
the 
pragmatic 
literacy 
on 
which 
they 
called 
in 
their 
day-to-day 
business
EOS
it 
is 
rather 
more 
likely 
that 
clerks 
had 
benefit 
of 
formal 
education 
than 
knights
EOS
but 
courts 
themselves 
were 
places 
of 
education
with 
the 
king 
of 
england 
it 
is 
school 
every 
day
as 
peter 
of 
blois 
remarked
EOS
and 
literacy
at 
least 
in 
the 
vernacular
could 
certainly 
be 
acquired 
without 
the 
aid 
of 
schooling
EOS
but 
whether 
directly 
or 
indirectly
the 
incipient 
bureaucracies 
clearly 
owed 
much 
to 
scholastic 
methods
to 
the 
categorization 
of 
information
the 
use 
of 
abstract 
nouns
and 
the 
search 
for 
system
that 
the 
schools 
had 
pioneered
EOS

administrators 
depended 
on 
their 
lord

favour
they 
devoted 
themselves

promoting 
his 
interests
EOS
here 
lay 
the 
spur 
to 
innovation
as 
can 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
norman 
and 
flemish 
accounting 
systems
which 
combined 
the 
techniques 
of 
survey 
and 
inquest 
with 
the 
new 
arithmetic 
to 
protect 
and 
increase 
the 
revenues 
available 
to 
the 
duke 
of 
normandy

the 
count 
of 
flanders
EOS
the 
norman 
exchequer 
probably 
instituted 
in 
the 
early 
years 
of 
the 
century
at 
the 
same 
time 
as 
its 
english 
counterpart
used 
the 
tally
the 
chequered 
cloth

the 
abacus 
to 
provide 
records 
for 
the 
illiterate

to 
overcome 
the 
considerable 
problems 
posed 
by 
the 
use 
of 
roman

addition

subtraction
EOS
these 
were 
not 
new 
expedients

their 
regular 
and 
systematic 
application 
to 
the 
ends 
of 
government 
effected 
a 
solid 
gain 
in 
efficiency
EOS
the 
aim 
of 
the 
norman 
exchequer 
rolls 
was 
to 
provide 
a 
complete 
record

due 
from

administrative 
unit 
of 
the 
duchy
EOS
the 
aim 
of 
the 
1187 
grote 
bref 
in 
flanders 
was 
a 
little 
different
in 
adding 
all 
revenues

expenditures 
together
it 
offered 
a 
rough 
estimate 
of 
the

there

not

a 
less 
exciting

equally 
innovative 
characteristic 
of 
princely

that

sufficient 
numbers

another

there

common 
sense 
may 
have 
been 
more 
important

war

as 
the

perceived 
the

early

mid 
eleventh

it 
enabled

claim

it

the 
logic

the

benefited 
materially

were 
far 
from

for

the 
achievements 
of 
raymond

in 
consolidating 
his 
authority 
within

threatened 
by 
his 
departure

especially 
since 
it 
was 
known 
that 
he 
had 
no 
intention

returning

EOS
then 
his 
example 
lured 
his 
elder

younger 
son 
alphonse

william

crusade

serious

decision 
to 
mortgage 
normandy

in 
order 
to 
cover 
his

exacerbated 
a 
conflict

not 
settled

the 
death 
of 
his 
son 
william 
clito

EOS
all 
in 
all
it 
was 
not 
surprising 
that 
suger
mulling 
over 
the 
precedents 
of 
early 
crusading
tried 
to 
dissuade 
louis 
vii 
from 
embarking 
on 
his 
jerusalem 
journey 
in 
1145
EOS
yet 
the 
appeal 
of 
crusading 
was
if 
anything
even 
stronger 
to 
those 
aristocratic 
houses 
just 
below 
the 
level 
of 
the 
princely
it 
was
after 
all
the 
house 
of 
boulogne

produced 
the 
first 
two

the 
counts 
of 
nevers
the 
lords 
of 
montpellier
the 
lords 
of 
amboise

lusignan
the 
trencavels
were 
fervent 
devotees 
of 
the

the 
problems 
of 
absences
shipwrecks
death 
abroad 
plagued 
them 
as 
much 
as  
their 
princes
EOS
on 
occasion
their 
determination 
to 
sacrifice 
for 
christ 
played 
directly 
into 
their 
overlord

hands
as 
when 
the 
count 
of 
la 
marche
who 
had 
no 
direct 
heir
sold 
his 
county 
to 
king 
henry 
ii

1177
EOS
when 
it 
did

joint 
crusading 
venture

the 
lord 
of 
amboise 
accompanied 
fulk 
v

hugh

william

created 
new 
personal 
links

the 
political 
spin-offs 
from 
crusading

therefore 
more 
difficult 
to 
calculate 
than 
at 
first 
glance 
they 
might 
appear
EOS
nevertheless 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
chief 
gainer 
was 
louis 
vii
EOS
the 
irony 
of 
this 
lay 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
second 
crusade 
was 
counter-productive 
in 
outremer
embittered 
relations 
with 
byzantium

resulted 
in 
the 
deaths

enormous 
numbers 
of 
its 
participants

those 
drawn 
from 
the 
non-aristocratic 
classes

yet 
it 
consolidated 
the 
king
's 
position 
within 
france
partly 
through 
the 
skilled 
regency 
of 
suger

also 
because
in 
taking 
on 
himself 
the 
leadership 
of 
the 
expedition
louis 
re-emerged 
as 
a 
credible 
ruler 
of 
men
EOS
his 
noble 
gesture 
appeased 
those 
churchmen 
who 
had 
been 
appalled 
by 
his 
early 
obstinacy 
over 
the 
archbishopric 
of 
bourges
EOS
the 
disasters 
that 
befell 
his 
army 
paradoxically 
heightened 
his 
personal 
charisma

the 
barons 
of 
outremer 
continued 
to 
look 
on 
him 
as 
their 
one 
potential 
saviour
EOS
his 
friendship 
with 
raymond 
v 
of 
toulouse
a 
fellow 
warrior
reversed 
the 
trend 
of 
history 
since 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
tenth 
century

bringing 
the 
princes 
of 
the 
far 
south 
back 
into 
the 
king

mouvance 
EOS
the 
crowds 
of 
burgundians 
who 
accompanied 
the 
king 
learned 
to 
respect 
him
on 
their 
return

sought 
the 
arbitration

the 
royal 
court

their 
disputes

they 
welcomed 
louis

intervention

counties

duchy

william

early

apparent 
that 
the 
crusading 
movement 
had 
provided 
a 
new 
sense

aristocratic 
cohesion  
in 
the 
realm
EOS
the 
great 
joint 
expeditions

combined
