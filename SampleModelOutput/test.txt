under-fives

in 
islington
1983
EOS
islington 
is 
a 
multi-ethnic
inner 
city 
london 
borough 
with 
a 
child 
population 
of 
29,000
EOS
in 
1982
44 
per 
cent 
of 
under 
fives 
in 
islington 
had 
the 
use 
of 
an 
under-fives 
facility
29 
per 
cent 
on 
a 
full-time 
and 
15 
per 
cent 
on 
a 
part-time 
basis
EOS
between 
1982 
and 
1988 
provision 
gradually 
increased
so 
that 
by 
1988 
there 
were 
12 
children
's 
day 
centres
about 
70 
playgroups 
and 
350 
assisted 
child-minding 
places 
funded 
partially 
or 
totally 
by 
the 
social 
services 
department
and 
1,075 
full-time 
and 
824 
part-time 
places 
in 
nursery 
schools 
funded 
by 
the 
inner 
london 
education 
authority
EOS
the 
beacon 
nursery
a 
local 
mencap 
project
offered 
care 
five 
days 
per 
week 
to 
children 
over 
one 
year 
of 
age 
categorised 
as 
having 
severe 
learning 
difficulties
EOS
unlike 
council 
day 
centres
playgroups 
or 
community 
nurseries
the 
beacon 
nursery 
was 
free
EOS
children 
were 
collected 
from 
home 
by 
special 
bus 
and 
places 
were 
available 
on 
demand
EOS
the 
beacon 
had 
been 
in 
existence 
for 
many 
years 
and 
in 
the 
past 
had 
catered 
for 
up 
to 
thirty 
children 
with 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
disabilities 
and 
needs
EOS
by 
1983 
it 
had 
half 
that 
number 
on 
roll
EOS
since 
1983 
numbers 
at 
the 
beacon 
continued 
to 
fall 
as 
it 
was 
increasingly 
seen 
as 
a 
resource 
for 
children 
with 
severe 
and 
multiple 
disabilities
EOS
in 
addition 
the 
elfreda 
rathbone  
organisation
a 
voluntary 
organisation 
helping 
people 
with 
learning 
disabilities
ran 
a 
free 
day 
nursery 
in 
the 
borough 
for 
a 
small 
number 
of 
children 
with 
learning 
difficulties
EOS
some 
integrated 
services 
emerged 
in 
the 
early 
1980s 
one 
playscheme 
was 
developed 
through 
a 
parent
's 
initiative
and 
an 
integrated 
adventure 
playground 
was 
established 
by 
a 
voluntary 
organisation
EOS
workers 
from 
the 
integrated 
playscheme 
subsequently 
supported 
a 
local 
special 
school 
in 
integrating 
under 
fives 
into 
a 
playgroup
EOS
in 
addition 
to 
its 
mainstream 
schools
the 
borough 
included 
five 
special 
schools 
providing 
primary 
and 
secondary 
education 
to 
children 
with 
special 
needs 
from 
islington 
and 
neighbouring 
boroughs 
one 
for 
children 
with 
moderate 
learning 
difficulties
one 
for 
children 
with 
severe 
learning 
difficulties
one 
for 
children 
with 
emotional 
and 
behavioural 
difficulties
one 
for 
autistic 
children
and 
one 
for 
children 
with 
physical 
disabilities
EOS
in 
1983 
three 
of 
these 
offered 
nursery 
places 
to 
children 
from 
the 
age 
of 
2
EOS
the 
children 
using 
all 
of 
these 
services 
came 
from 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
ethnic 
backgrounds
though 
rarely 
was 
this 
actively 
and 
positively 
reflected 
in 
the 
type 
of 
care 
provided 
or 
the 
ethnic 
background 
of 
their 
carers
EOS
residential 
units
EOS
by 
1983 
residential 
services 
were 
designed 
with 
care 
in 
the 
community
in 
mind
but 
most 
were 
based 
in 
specialist 
settings
EOS
for 
example
field 
end 
house 
had 
been 
open 
for 
three 
years 
as 
a 
specialist 
unit 
for 
children 
with 
learning 
difficulties
and 
was 
designed 
to 
offer 
respite 
round 
the 
clock
care
EOS
parents 
had 
fought 
for 
this 
as 
a 
local 
resource 
to 
prevent 
the 
need 
for 
children 
to 
be 
placed 
in 
long-stay 
placements 
far 
from 
home
EOS
by 
1988 
field 
end 
had 
been 
joined 
by 
another 
specialist 
children
's 
respite 
care 
unit 
at 
leigh 
road
EOS
the 
social 
services 
department 
also 
provided 
thirteen 
short-term 
and 
long-term 
residential 
units 
for 
children 
in 
care 
by 
1988 
their 
number 
had 
been 
reduced 
to 
eleven
none 
with 
wheelchair 
access 
and 
only 
one 
with 
any 
experience 
of 
caring 
for 
children 
with 
learning 
difficulties
EOS
the 
community 
health 
team
EOS
the 
community 
health 
team 
had 
major 
responsibility 
for 
assessing 
children 
and 
recommending 
provision
EOS
it 
included 
physiotherapists
occupational 
and 
speech 
therapists
doctors
psychologists 
and 
a 
specialist 
health 
visitor
EOS
they 
were 
joined 
in 
the 
network 
by 
specialist 
teachers
funded 
by 
the 
ilea 
and 
based 
in 
the 
special 
schools
who 
visited 
children 
at 
home 
before 
they 
were 
due 
to 
start 
school
EOS
this 
group 
of 
people 
met 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
to 
coordinate 
services 
and 
discuss 
professional 
issues
EOS
discussion 
of 
services 
to 
individual 
children 
also 
took 
place
EOS
this 
included 
deciding 
between 
day 
care 
or 
school
and 
parents
' 
attitudes  
to 
different 
options
EOS
often 
a 
member 
of 
the 
group 
was 
delegated 
to 
advise 
parents 
on 
a 
course 
of 
action
EOS
the 
community 
health 
team 
aim 
was 
to 
ensure 
a 
place 
of 
treatment 
for 
children 
from 
the 
earliest 
possible 
age
to 
enable 
them 
to 
develop 
to 
their 
fullest 
potential
EOS
they 
were
however
an 
all-white 
group
operating 
without 
directly 
involving 
parents 
and 
were 
generally 
committed 
to 
specialist 
care 
in 
the 
community
EOS
they 
gave 
support 
to 
the 
beacon 
and 
elfreda 
rathbone 
nurseries 
and 
most 
members 
saw 
these 
settings 
as 
the 
best 
places 
to 
treat
children
EOS
because 
of 
their 
early 
contact 
with 
parents 
they 
often 
had 
considerable 
influence 
in 
steering 
parents 
towards 
specialist 
provision
EOS
the 
special 
services 
team
EOS
in 
the 
early 
1980s 
social 
workers 
were 
funded 
jointly 
by 
the 
ilea 
and 
islington 
social 
services 
department 
to 
work 
with 
children 
attending 
two 
special 
schools 
and 
two 
specialist 
units 
for 
partially 
hearing
children
EOS
these 
social 
workers 
were 
based 
in 
the 
borough
's 
special 
services 
team
EOS
they 
all 
worked 
with 
some 
under 
fives 
attending 
the 
schools 
they 
covered
EOS
they 
were 
aware 
of 
a 
number 
of 
pre-school 
children 
who 
did 
not 
have 
adequate 
access 
to 
resources 
or 
support 
when 
parents 
and 
professionals 
were 
becoming 
aware 
of 
the 
possible 
extent 
and 
implications 
of 
the 
disability
EOS
when 
a 
vacancy 
arose 
within 
this 
group 
of 
social 
workers 
in 
1983 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
appoint 
someone 
specialising 
in 
work 
with 
under 
fives 
with 
special 
needs
EOS
this 
might 
have 
had 
the 
effect 
of 
drawing 
families 
into 
the 
specialist 
system 
at 
an 
earlier 
stage
EOS
instead
for 
a 
number 
of 
reasons
it 
proved 
to 
be 
a 
key 
step 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
debate 
about 
integration 
in 
islington
EOS
first
the 
post 
was 
not 
attached 
to 
any 
specialist 
institution
EOS
there 
was 
an 
expectation 
but 
not 
a 
contractual 
obligation 
that 
the 
postholder 
would 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
beacon 
nursery
EOS
second
the 
worker 
had 
an 
alternative 
peer 
group 
of 
under-fives 
workers 
who 
were 
key 
figures 
in 
controlling 
access 
to 
all 
other 
under-fives 
facilities
EOS
third
the 
worker 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
idea 
that 
treatment 
of 
a 
medical 
or 
disabling 
condition 
should 
not 
take 
precedence 
over 
the 
child
's 
social
emotional 
and 
cultural 
needs
EOS
there 
was 
now 
a 
new 
worker 
in 
the 
network 
who 
also 
made 
an 
early 
relationship 
with 
families 
but 
who 
could 
present 
a 
broader 
choice 
of 
day 
care 
to 
parents
EOS
attempting 
an 
integration 
policy
EOS
the 
labour 
council
elected 
in 
1982
had 
as 
a 
stated 
policy 
aim 
that 
every 
child 
whose 
parents 
so 
wished 
was 
entitled 
to 
a 
pre-school 
place 
of 
some 
sort
EOS
this 
led 
to 
the 
initiation 
of 
an 
under-fives 
review
EOS
the 
review 
team
set 
up 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
social 
services 
committee
included 
councillors
senior 
departmental 
management 
and 
representatives 
of 
the 
children
's 
day 
centre 
organisers 
and 
under-fives 
social 
workers 
in 
its 
membership
EOS
it 
proposed 
a 
network 
of  
under-fives 
centres 
throughout 
the 
borough 
an 
idea 
which 
the 
under-fives 
workers 
had 
been 
anxious 
to 
promote 
for 
some 
time
EOS
day 
care 
in 
each 
area 
would 
be 
organised 
and 
coordinated 
through 
the 
children
's 
day 
centres 
which 
would 
also 
provide 
information
support 
and 
resources 
to 
parents
EOS
the 
review 
had 
made 
no 
mention 
of 
children 
with 
special 
needs
EOS
the 
specialist 
social 
worker 
and 
another 
under-fives 
worker 
with 
a 
personal 
interest 
in 
the 
issues 
undertook 
a 
supplementary 
review 
to 
examine 
resources 
for 
these 
children
EOS
they 
interviewed 
parents
specialist 
professionals 
and 
mainstream 
day-care 
workers 
and 
they 
designed 
a 
questionnaire 
which 
was 
completed 
by 
workers 
in 
a 
large 
proportion 
of 
mainstream 
council 
services 
and 
voluntary 
organisations
as 
well 
as 
by 
some 
child-minders
EOS
broadly
the 
survey 
confirmed 
that 
parents 
of 
children 
with 
special 
needs 
had 
not 
been 
given 
a 
real 
choice 
of 
placement
and 
that 
they 
had 
to 
fight 
hard 
for 
mainstream 
provision 
if 
this 
was 
their 
choice
EOS
parents 
wanted 
to 
be 
part 
of 
the 
decision-making 
and 
did 
not 
feel 
that 
they 
were
EOS
many 
commented 
on 
lack 
of 
information 
about 
the 
range 
of 
facilities 
on 
offer
EOS
one 
afro-caribbean 
woman 
described 
how 
she 
felt 
that 
she 
was 
never 
given 
a 
choice 
of 
provision 
for 
her 
son
and 
objected 
to 
being 
told 
he 
should 
be 
in 
a 
specialist 
nursery 
for 
his 
own 
good
EOS
she 
fought 
hard 
to 
get 
him 
a 
part-time 
playgroup 
place 
in 
the 
group 
his 
older 
brother 
attended
EOS
because 
the 
group 
had 
known 
her 
and 
her 
children 
for 
some 
time 
they 
agreed 
to 
have 
a 
go
and 
the 
placement 
went 
ahead
EOS
she 
commented
EOS
i 
had 
to 
fight 
every 
step 
of 
the 
way 
for 
this
EOS
no 
one 
told 
me 
about 
it
and 
no 
one 
wanted 
him 
to 
have 
it
EOS
i 
knew 
it 
was 
right 
for 
him 
this 
is 
where 
he 
learnt 
to 
join 
in 
and 
be 
like 
other 
children
EOS
it 
does
n't 
matter 
that 
he
's 
not 
like 
them
EOS
i 
know 
what 
is 
right 
for 
my 
child
but 
i
'm 
not 
supposed 
to 
say
EOS
parents 
also 
wanted 
an 
increased 
availability 
of 
specialist 
therapy
time
but 
wanted 
it 
to 
be 
used 
in 
a 
more 
flexible 
way
EOS
some 
parents 
were 
very 
worried 
that 
more 
integrated 
settings 
would 
lead 
to 
lack 
of 
attention 
for 
children 
with 
special 
needs
EOS
definitions 
of 
special 
needs
varied 
widely 
in 
the 
questionnaire 
responses 
some 
defining 
it 
as 
children 
with 
disabilities
some 
including 
children 
with 
behavioural 
and 
emotional 
problems 
and 
some 
including 
children 
whose 
first 
language 
was 
not 
english
EOS
this 
made 
the 
survey 
difficult 
to 
interpret
EOS
the 
findings 
were 
documented 
in 
a 
report 
a 
place 
for 
all 
our 
children 
ccuf 
1983
and 
an 
analysis 
was 
prepared 
of 
the 
practical 
and 
bureaucratic 
problems 
in 
gaining 
an 
ordinary 
childcare 
place 
for 
a 
child 
with 
special 
needs
with 
suggestions 
for 
how 
these 
might 
be 
overcome
EOS
these 
ideas 
were 
informed 
by 
a 
paper 
which 
had 
already 
been 
produced 
by 
an 
active 
member 
of 
the 
local 
mencap

it

clear 
that

responsibility

of

EOS
the 
message 
came 
loud 
and 
clear 
from 
all 
quarters 
that 
until 
council 
services 
were 
more 
welcoming 
to

of 
caution

unfortunately
at 
this 
point 
neither 
senior 
management 
staff 
in 
the 
social  
services 
department 
nor 
the 
local 
councillors 
involved 
in 
the

presented 
the

report 
to 
the 
social

EOS
the 
core 
group 
who 
organised 
the 
conference 
were 
basic 
grade 
workers 
in 
the 
department 
who 
did 
not 
know 
the 
processes 
by 
which 
policy 
change 
is 
effected
EOS
as 
a 
result 
there 
was 
no 
informed 
discussion 
within 
the 
department 
or 
at 
the 
social 
services 
committee 
about 
resource 
issues 
and 
the 
status 
of 
the 
recommendations 
remained 
vague
EOS
the 
sub-committee
EOS
in 
the 
absence 
of 
official 
support 
we 
established 
a 
special 
needs 
sub-committee 
of 
the 
coordinating 
committee 
for 
under 
fives 
to 
further 
the 
conference 
recommendations 
and 
the 
proposals 
of 
the 
fish 
report 
ilea 
1985
on 
special 
education 
provision 
within 
ilea
which 
favoured 
integration
EOS
the 
group 
eventually 
included 
representatives 
from 
health
education 
and 
social 
services 
with 
a 
small 
representation 
of 
parents 
and 
voluntary 
groups
EOS
battles 
were 
waged 
in 
meetings 
of 
the 
sub-committee 
and 
the 
level 
of 
organisational 
resistance 
to 
change 
became 
clear
EOS
many 
community 
health 
workers 
attended 
and 
expressed 
their 
scepticism 
about 
moves 
to 
greater 
integration
EOS
they 
said 
children 
needed 
trained 
professionals 
to 
care 
for 
them 
and 
carry 
out 
their 
treatment 
programmes
EOS
they 
also 
felt 
that 
specialist 
workers 
could 
pass 
on 
skills 
and 
ideas 
to 
others
but 
it 
would 
take 
time
EOS
if 
children 
were 
integrated
workers 
would 
have 
to 
travel 
to 
many 
different 
centres 
and 
spend 
time 
training 
carers
EOS
their 
aim 
was 
care 
in 
the 
community
but 
not 
anywhere 
in 
the 
community
EOS
interestingly
few 
of 
the 
workers 
at 
the 
beacon 
or 
elfreda 
rathbone 
had 
specialist
training
but 
they 
had 
experience 
of 
specialist 
segregated 
provision 
and 
an 
approach 
which 
focused 
on 
the 
special 
needs
of 
a 
child 
rather 
than 
on 
total 
needs
EOS
the 
progress 
of 
integration
EOS
despite 
professional 
and 
organisational 
inertia 
and 
resistance
some 
things 
did 
happen
EOS
there 
were 
a 
number 
of 
areas 
where 
greater 
willingness 
was 
apparent 
to 
include 
children 
with 
special 
needs 
and 
make 
services 
more 
locally 
responsive
EOS
day-care 
provision
EOS
successful 
integrated 
day-care 
placements 
for 
under 
fives 
were 
negotiated 
by 
the 
specialist 
social 
worker 
and 
the 
parents
or 
sometimes 
the 
parents 
alone 
or 
the 
parents 
with 
another 
committed 
individual
EOS
it 
involved 
hard 
work 
and 
long 
discussions
dealing 
with 
fears
anxieties 
and 
practical 
problems
which 
needed 
to 
continue 
long 
after 
the 
child 
had 
been 
placed
EOS
even 
when 
day 
centres 
or 
playgroups 
were 
willing 
they 
were 
often 
still 
very 
nervous
and 
afraid 
of 
making 
mistakes
EOS
this 
could 
lead 
to 
over-protectiveness 
and 
care 
had 
to 
be 
taken 
to 
ensure 
that 
a 
child 
was 
involved 
in 
all 
the

activities

playgroups
EOS
following 
the 
ccuf 
conference 
playgroups 
responded 
most 
rapidly
EOS
to 
some 
degree 
they 
had 
already 
been 
catering 
for 
children 
with 
special 
needs
EOS
because 
of 
their 
small 
size 
and 
their 
close 
connections 
with 
local

playgroups 
were 
responsive 
and 
flexible 
in 
their 
way

working
EOS
despite 
unsuitable 
premises
lack 
of 
funding

a 
dearth

support 
from 
the

many 
groups 
tried 
hard 
to 
accommodate 
children

EOS
their 
staff 
were 
generally 
willing 
to 
have 
a 
go

with 
some 
information 
and 
support 
went 
a 
long 
way 
in 
challenging 
their 
own 
attitudes 
and 
those 
of 
other 
children 
and 
parents
EOS
some 
children 
moved 
out 
of 
specialist 
provision 
into 
playgroups 
full 
or 
part 
time
and 
made 
considerable 
strides 
in 
social 
relationships
becoming 
part 
of 
a 
community

friendship 
network

continued

their 
schooldays

although 
it 
was 
policy 
for 
all 
children 
to 
be 
welcome 
in 
council 
provision
in 
reality 
this 
was 
highly 
variable
EOS
access 
was 
dependent 
on 
parents 
receiving 
the 
information 
and 
encouragement 
to 
apply
experiencing 
the 
organiser

of 
the 
centre 
as 
welcoming 
and 
willing 
to 
learn 
about

accommodate 
the

had 
to 
be 
willing

become 
available
EOS
some 
extremely 
successful 
placements 
have 
been 
made 
in 
council 
day 
centres
EOS
sometimes 
centres 
were 
able 
to 
relieve 
any 
additional 
pressure 
on 
staff

allocating 
the 
equivalent 
of 
two 
places 
to 
one

some 
cases 
extra 
support

been 
unnecessary

child-minding
EOS
a 
few 
children 
were 
also 
placed 
with 
child-minders
who 
were 
awarded 
additional 
payments 
by 
the 
council 
if 
the 
child 
required 
sufficient 
extra 
attention 
that 
s/he 
needed 
to 
take 
up 
more 
than 
one

this 
led 
to 
battles

questioned

to 
implement 
the 
new

the 
specialist

EOS
the 
beacon 
nursery 
was 
taken 
over 
by 
the

requested 
by

this 
could 
have 
provided 
opportunities

structural 
change

review
EOS
these 
never 
took 
place
EOS
senior 
management 
failed 
to 
take 
a 
lead 
in 
clarifying 
the 
role 
of 
the 
beacon 
in 
the 
department
's 
services 
to 
under 
fives
EOS
what 
did 
happen 
was 
that 
the 
nursery 
staff 
felt 
themselves 
to 
be 
part 
of 
a 
wider 
childcare 
system 
and 
took 
advantage 
of 
formal 
and 
informal 
links
EOS
there 
was 
exchange 
of 
information 
and  
sometimes 
of 
staff 
and 
children
EOS
the 
nursery 
was 
also 
influenced 
by 
the 
council
's 
equal 
opportunities 
policies 
for 
example
staff 
took 
part 
in 
a 
conference 
considering 
anti-racist 
strategies 
with 
under 
fives
EOS
a 
consideration 
of 
these 
ideas 
fostered 
the 
recognition 
that 
the 
children 
had 
social
racial 
and 
cultural 
identities 
as 
well 
as 
disabilities
EOS
as 
a 
result 
of 
more 
able 
children 
taking 
up 
integrated 
placements 
or 
moving 
into 
school
the 
beacon 
was 
now 
catering

a 
very 
small

multiply 
disabled

highly 
segregated

residential

as 
a 
result 
of 
two 
consultation 
days 
held 
to 
examine 
possibilities 
for 
greater 
integration 
in 
residential 
provision 
for 
children 
and 
young 
people 
with 
special 
needs
a 
series 
of 
recommendations 
were 
made 
to 
and 
accepted 
by 
the 
social 
services 
committee 
in 
january 
1987
EOS
these 
included
developing 
a 
respite 
care 
service
improving 
mobility 
access 
in 
children

residential 
units
providing 
disability 
awareness 
training
developing 
a 
coordinated 
assessment 
and 
review 
system 
for 
all 
children 
arid 
developing 
services 
for 
young 
adults
EOS
most 
of 
these 
recommendations 
affected

under 
fives
EOS
respite 
care
EOS
the 
family 
care 
scheme
which 
provided 
care 
for 
children 
in 
their 
own 
homes 
was 
from 
its 
inception 
open 
to 
children 
with 
disabilities 
and 
their 
families
EOS
again 
this 
was 
possible
at 
least 
in 
part
because 
the 
scheme 
coordinator 
was 
personally 
committed 
to 
such 
provision
EOS
following 
the 
consultation 
days 
a 
pilot 
respite 
care 
scheme 
was 
begun 
offering 
twenty 
days 
respite 
care 
per 
year 
to 
ten 
families
to 
be 
planned 
at 
times 
and 
in 
ways 
to 
suit 
the 
families 
concerned
EOS
priority 
is 
being 
given

the 
time

the 
consultation 
exercise

drawn 
up

short-term

on 
completion
the

after

fundamental 
structural 
change

that 
all 
day

residential 
services 
were 
managed 
through 
the 
neighbourhood

they 
were 
situated
EOS
the 
department 
was 
reorganised 
into 
five 
geographical 
districts
each 
managed 
by 
an 
assistant 
director

also 
had 
a 
responsibility 
for 
particular 
service 
areas
EOS
the 
way 
these 
responsibilities 
were 
divided

difficulties

three 
different 
assistant

responsibilities 
relating

one 
for

another 
for 
older 
children

their

a 
third 
for

physical

EOS
each 
neighbourhood 
office 
was 
allocated 
a 
half-time 
under-fives 
worker 
post
despite 
a 
large 
increase 
in 
workload
EOS
it 
was 
almost 
inevitable 
that 
this 
would 
have 
a 
negative 
effect 
on 
any 
innovative 
work
EOS
the 
issue 
of 
integration 
began 
to 
lose 
its 
visibility
EOS
attitudes
especially 
among 
new

often 
at 
variance

stated 
philosophy

towards 
integration

the 
cuts
EOS
as 
a 
result 
of 
central 
government 
policies
islington 
social 
services 
suffered 
8 
per 
cent 
cuts 
in 
1987/8 
and 
all 
departments 
were 
asked 
to 
produce 
proposals 
for 
cuts 
of 
up 
to 
a 
further 
25 
per 
cent 
which 
they 
might 
have 
to 
achieve 
over 
the 
next 
two 
years
EOS
cuts 
of 
that 
level 
would 
decimate 
the 
existing 
service 
and 
make 
it 
almost 
impossible 
for 
underdeveloped 
areas 
of 
the 
service 
such 
as 
facilities 
for 
children 
with 
physical 
disabilities
imaginative 
respite

family-based 
care

under-fives 
facilities

be 
developed
EOS
under-fives 
services 
were 
not 
identified 
as 
a 
priority
EOS
instead
it 
proposed 
that 
the 
beacon 
and 
six 
other 
children
's 
day 
centres 
be 
closed 
over 
the 
next 
two 
years

an 
increase 
in

child-minding

compensate

part
for 
this 
loss
EOS
the 
care 
provided 
by 
the 
beacon 
was 
to 
transfer 
to 
special 
units 
in 
the 
remaining 
children

day 
centres

it 
is 
ironic

radical

resisted 
by 
some 
specialist

all

now 
to 
be 
enforced

EOS
the 
danger 
was 
that 
the 
department 
would 
end 
up 
with 
the 
worst 
of 
both 
worlds 
an 
integrated 
service 
provided 
in 
a 
hastily 
planned 
way
foisted 
on 
staff 
unprepared 
for 
the 
challenge 
and 
lacking 
the 
positive 
commitment

support 
that 
is 
so 
necessary

specialist 
staff

their 
managers
EOS
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
ilea
EOS
legislation

it 
the 
central 
government 
decision 
to 
abolish 
the 
inner 
london 
education 
authority 
ilea

1990

the 
opposition 
of 
93

london
EOS
for

this 
meant 
that

day-to-day 
running

management

EOS
in 
particular 
these 
london-wide 
resources 
have 
been 
used 
to 
provide 
facilities 
for 
children 
with 
special 
needs 
in 
specialist 
day 
and 
boarding 
schools
EOS
the 
borough 
brought 
in 
a 
group 
of 
consultants 
to 
produce 
topic 
papers 
on 
twelve 
of 
the 
major 
areas 
affected 
by 
abolition
EOS
these 
included 
issues 
of 
equality
special 
needs 
and 
services 
for 
under 
fives
EOS
before 
the 
decision 
on 
its 
abolition
the 
ilea 
had 
already 
virtually 
abandoned 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
fish 
report
although 
some 
of 
the 
topic 
papers 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
idea 
of 
integration 
in 
general
unspecified 
ways
EOS
the 
paper 
on 
special 
needs 
however
written 
by 
a 
former 
director 
of 
the 
local 
ilea 
division
raised 
the 
integration 
principle 
as 
one 
which 
was 
again 
open 
for 
discussion 
and 
decision
EOS
the 
document 
stated 
that 
the 
arguments 
for 
and 
against 
would 
be 
set 
out 
in 
some 
detail
EOS
the 
only 
argument 
stated 
in 
its 
favour
however
was 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
fish 
report 
ideas 
on 
equality
EOS
the 
author 
roy 
price
then 
went 
on 
to 
state 
that 
integration 
may 
not 
be 
practicable
and 
that 
segregation 
is 
a 
way 
to 
later 
integration
EOS
he 
gave 
the 
example 
of 
a 
two-year 
community 
skills 
course 
in 
a 
local 
college 
that 
drew 
its 
recruits 
from 
the 
special 
schools
EOS
he 
also 
argued 
that 
the 
campaign 
for 
choice 
in 
education 
advocated 
specialism
EOS
it 
so 
happened 
that 
a 
local 
head 
of 
a 
special 
school 
was 
very 
involved 
in 
this 
campaign
EOS
finally
he 
suggested 
that 
opportunities 
for 
increased 
parent/governor 
control 
and 
opting-out
under 
the 
education 
reform 
act 
might 
mean 
that 
schools 
would 
become 
more 
competitive 
and 
less 
likely 
to 
want 
to 
pursue 
integration
EOS
most 
people 
in 
islington
councillors 
included
were 
unlikely 
to 
have 
read 
the 
fish 
report 
or 
to 
be 
aware 
of 
the 
arguments 
put 
forward 
in 
it
EOS
in 
such 
a 
context 
roy 
price
's 
description 
of 
the 
issues 
involved 
struck 
us 
as 
extremely 
lopsided
EOS
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
ilea 
also 
had 
a 
direct 
impact 
in 
the 
under-fives 
field
EOS
the 
under-fives 
topic 
paper 
suggested 
that 
all 
group 
provision 
for 
under 
fives 
should 
be 
organised 
through 
the 
new 
borough 
education 
department
EOS
this 
would 
lead 
to 
the 
transfer 
of 
children
's 
day 
centres 
from 
social 
work 
to 
education 
and 
their 
possible 
future 
demise
EOS
it 
contained 
a 
plan 
to 
halve 
the 
number 
of 
places 
in 
children
's 
day 
centres 
from 
1989
EOS
the 
number 
of 
subsidised 
child-minding 
places 
was 
to 
be 
increased
but 
this 
would 
not 
provide 
the 
group 
experience 
that 
is 
such 
a 
valuable 
aspect 
of 
day 
centre 
provision
EOS
neither 
would 
it 
allow 
for 
flexible 
staff 
allocation 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
children 
with 
particular 
disabilities
EOS
it 
was 
unclear 
where 
responsibility 
for 
child-minders
registration 
of 
playgroups
etc. 
would 
rest 
in 
the 
new 
organisation
but 
it 
was 
possible 
that 
the 
new 
provisions 
in 
the 
children 
bill 
going 
through 
parliament 
would 
allow 
for 
those 
services 
to 
be 
provided 
through 
education 
departments
EOS
despite 
the 
difficulties 
in 
changing 
attitudes 
outlined 
in 
this 
chapter
there 
is 
little 
doubt 
that 
workers 
in 
mainstream 
social 
services 
provision 
were 
more 
prepared 
to 
accept 
the 
idea 
and 
practical 
implications 
of 
integration 
provision 
than 
those 
in 
mainstream 
education
EOS
in 
such 
a 
situation 
the 
future 
for 
integration 
looked 
bleak
EOS
the 
transfer 
of 
ilea 
responsibilities 
to 
the 
council 
meant 
that 
future 
decisions 
around 
integration 
and 
children 
would 
be 
mainly 
the 
brief 
of 
the 
new 
education 
committee
EOS
this 
committee 
was 
likely 
to 
be 
more 
responsive 
to 
lobbying 
and 
pressure 
from 
parents 
of 
children 
already 
in 
mainstream
schools 
and 
from 
the 
huge 
workforce 
in 
mainstream 
and 
specialist 
education
EOS
such 
a 
powerbase 
is 
potentially 
much 
more 
difficult 
to 
change 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
a 
small 
discriminated-against 
group
EOS
the 
cuts 
and 
internal 
reorganisation 
in 
the 
ilea 
also 
resulted 
in 
a 
total 
turn-about 
on 
decisions 
concerning 
the 
specialist 
social 
worker 
post
EOS
when 
the 
postholder 
left 
in 
december 
1987
the 
post 
was 
redesignated 
to 
a 
special 
school
EOS
once 
again 
all 
social 
workers 
in 
the 
special 
services 
team 
were 
to 
be 
attached 
to 
special 
schools 
with 
under 
fives 
inevitably 
drawn 
into 
the 
specialist 
system 
again
EOS
shortly 
after 
this 
regressive 
move 
the 
post 
was 
cut 
completely

concluding 
remarks
EOS
in 
1988
integrated 
placements 
are 
still 
being 
achieved 
against 
the 
tide
EOS
there 
was 
still 
a 
lack 
of 
commitment 
to 
integration 
from 
social 
services
health 
and 
education
even 
though 
individuals 
within 
those 
services 
were 
becoming 
increasingly 
willing 
to 
help
EOS
parents 
were 
still 
placed 
under 
enormous 
pressure 
to 
choose 
specialist 
resources 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
child
integrated 
placements 
were 
often 
presented 
as 
chiefly 
fulfilling 
a 
selfish 
need 
of 
the 
parents 
to 
deny 
their 
child
's 
special 
needs
EOS
a 
coordinated 
assessment 
and 
review 
system 
for 
all 
children 
had 
proved 
difficult 
to 
develop
EOS
children 
with 
disabilities 
and 
their 
parents 
tend 
to 
have 
most 
contact 
with 
specialist 
health
education 
and 
social 
services 
during 
the 
child
's  
early 
years
EOS
until 
the 
three 
agencies 
actively 
involve 
parents 
and 
staff 
from 
non-specialist 
areas 
in 
their 
assessment 
and 
review 
procedures 
and 
give 
equal 
weight 
to 
the 
promotion 
and 
consideration 
of 
integrated 
placements
such 
placements 
will 
remain 
a 
rarity
EOS
staff 
and 
parents 
need 
to 
be 
strongly 
motivated 
to 
seek 
an 
integrated 
placement 
in 
a 
children
's 
day 
centre 
or 
nursery

EOS
the 
local 
specialist 
nursery

had 
a 
much 
shorter 
waiting 
list

provided 
by

EOS
it 
demanded 
interest

commitment 
on 
the 
part

the 
workers 
to 
try 
and 
set 
up 
respite

placements 
are 
most 
successful 
when 
the 
policy-makers

professionals 
involved 
have 
a 
positive 
attitude 
to 
exploring 
integrated 
care 
and 
are 
willing 
to 
support 
the 
care-givers

the 
parents
EOS

withdrawn

it 
is 
very 
obvious 
from 
our 
experience 
that 
attitude 
is 
at

as 
crucial 
as

arguments 
around 
cost 
sometimes 
act 
as 
a 
smoke-screen

it

wales

are 
so 
convinced 
of 
each 
family
's 
right 
to 
choice 
of 
provision 
for 
their 
children 
that 
they 
have 
taken 
positive 
steps 
to 
make 
this 
possible
EOS
county 
referral 
schemes
have 
been 
established 
to 
ease 
the 
integration 
of 
children 
with 
special 
needs 
into 
the 
local 
playgroup 
or 
mother 
and 
toddler 
group
EOS
once 
a 
family 
contacts 
or 
is 
referred 
to 
the 
referral 
scheme 
coordinator 
every 
assistance 
is 
given 
to 
that 
family 
to 
link 
into 
their 
local 
community 
group 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
group 
is 
physically 
suitable 
and 
that 
any 
special 
assistance 
needed 
to 
enable 
the 
child 
to 
attend 
the 
group 
and 
enjoy 
its 
activities 
is 
provided
EOS
playgroups 
and 
mother 
and 
toddler 
groups 
offer 
safe 
and 
stimulating 
play 
opportunities 
for 
the 
children 
and 
friendship 
for 
mother 
and 
child
EOS
playgroups 
are 
set 
up 
and 
managed 
by 
parent 
members 
of 
the 
group
usually 
through 
a 
committee 
and 
employing 
a 
playgroup 
leader
EOS
the 
groups 
take 
place 
in 
a 
church 
or 
chapel

other 
community 
building

are 
supported

finding 
their 
way
EOS
children 
with 
special 
needs 
have 
long 
been 
welcomed 
into 
playgroups 
or 
mother 
and 
toddler 
groups 
but 
members 
have 
tended 
to 
worry 
on 
two 
counts 
first
that 
only 
a 
minority 
of 
families 
with 
children 
with 
special 
needs 
were 
finding 
their  
way 
to 
playgroup
and 
second 
that 
the 
playgroup 
was 
not 
fully 
able 
to 
meet 
the 
children
's 
needs
EOS
two 
counties
clwyd 
and 
south 
glamorgan
took 
the 
lead 
and 
the 
nucleus 
of 
a 
ppa 
special 
needs 
referral 
scheme 
was 
established 
in 
each 
county 
in 
the 
early 
1980s
EOS
in 
1983 
the 
welsh

produced 
a

this 
document 
proclaimed 
to 
the 
people 
of

that 
members

a 
right 
to 
the

the

conjunction 
with 
voluntary

members 
of 
wales 
ppa 
quickly 
realised 
that 
these 
published 
beliefs 
were 
the 
same 
as 
their 
own
and 
that 
here 
was 
perhaps 
an 
opportunity 
to 
avail 
themselves 
of 
much-needed 
funding

establish 
support

enable

development

an 
all

EOS
ppa

joined 
these

with 
a 
view 
to

resource 
for

high

this 
involved

in

the

to 
fund 
a 
special

introduction
EOS
transition 
from 
school 
to 
adult 
and 
working 
life 
has 
been 
receiving 
increased 
attention 
in 
most 
developed 
countries 
over 
the 
last 
decade
EOS
at 
first 
this 
was 
because 
of 
high 
levels 
of 
youth 
unemployment 
and 
latterly 
because 
of 
demographic 
trends
EOS
these 
show 
a 
growing 
number 
of 
older 
people 
entering 
active 
retirement 
and 
much 
smaller 
youth 
age 
groups 
entering 
employment
EOS
as 
a 
result 
it 
is 
important 
to 
create 
as 
many 
wage-earners 
and 
taxpayers 
as 
possible
EOS
a 
smaller 
labour 
market 
creates 
a 
window 
of 
employment 
opportunity 
for 
minority 
groups
including 
those 
who 
are 
disabled
EOS
it 
presents 
a 
chance 
to 
establish 
employment 
as 
a 
natural 
conclusion 
to 
education 
and 
training 
for 
these 
groups
EOS
in 
many 
instances 
expectations 
have 
been 
too 
low
EOS
when 
decisions 
about 
employability 
are 
based 
on 
school 
performance 
rather 
than 
on 
work 
experience
training 
opportunities 
are 
often 
limited
EOS
recent 
developments 
have 
shown 
that 
appropriate 
education
training 
and 
direct 
experience 
of 
work 
and 
living 
away 
from 
home
can 
enable 
a 
very 
significant 
proportion 
of 
those 
with 
severe 
disabilities 
to 
maintain 
themselves 
in 
employment

has 
been 
wide 
agreement 
about 
the 
importance 
of 
transition

the 
nature

the 
process
EOS
the 
work 
has 
led 
to 
the 
development 
of 
a 
conceptual 
framework 
for 
a 
period

is 
both 
a 
phase 
and 
a 
process
EOS
it 
is 
a 
time-phase 
between 
childhood 
and 
adulthood

a 
process 
of 
changing 
from 
a 
pupil 
to 
an 
independent 
working 
adult
EOS
there 
is 
also 
agreement 
about 
many 
major 
issues 
which 
need 
to 
be 
addressed
EOS
finally
there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
effective 
innovations

have 
been

handicapping

in

the

are 
not 
always 
impressive
EOS
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
inequalities 
of 
the 
education 
system 
that 
the 
more 
successful 
you 
are 
the 
longer 
you 
can 
remain 
in 
it

thus 
delay 
independence

requires 
greater 
cooperation 
between

the

EOS
this 
will 
be

EOS
the 
movement

to 
supporting

in 
the

the 
support 
of 
more

the 
general 
management 
of

create 
a

essential
EOS
changes

provide 
more 
flexible

EOS
finally
new 
employment

training 
arrangements 
are 
being 
introduced 
through

contribute

EOS
although 
an 
individual 
makes 
many 
important 
transitions 
in 
a 
lifetime
that 
from 
school 
through 
adolescence 
to 
adult

is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important
EOS
for 
a 
young 
person 
with 
a 
disability 
or 
learning 
difficulty 
this 
transition 
is 
crucial
EOS
transition 
is 
a 
personal 
and 
confused 
process 
for 
the 
individual 
but 
for 
national
local 
and 
voluntary 
departments 
and 
agencies 
it 
is 
a 
period 
of 
divided 
responsibilities 
and 
fragmentation
EOS
during 
the 
compulsory 
school 
period 
there 
are 
usually 
only 
two 
centres
home 
and 
school
which 
coordinate 
services 
for 
children
EOS
after 
that 
period 
there 
are 
many 
independent 
contributors
EOS
the 
secondary 
school
the 
further 
education 
college 
and 
the 
adult 
education 
service
health
social 
and 
employment 
services
all 
have 
potential 
contributions 
to 
make 
as 
have 
voluntary 
agencies
EOS
this 
confusion 
between 
providers 
is 
compounded 
by 
the 
different 
definitions 
used 
by 
departments 
and 
agencies 
to 
identify 
their 
clients
EOS
for 
example
education 
acts 
use 
relative 
definitions 
of 
performance 
separating 
disability 
and 
performance 
but 
the 
1986 
disabled 
persons 
act 
uses 
1948 
social 
security 
definitions 
of 
disability
EOS
some 
definitions 
may 
be 
administrative
others 
functional 
and 
some 
may 
encompass 
a 
wider 
group 
than 
others
EOS
after 
school
individuals 
can  
move 
into 
and 
out 
of 
departmental 
definitions
EOS
there 
are 
also 
attempts 
by 
agencies 
to 
establish 
an 
ownership 
of 
clients
EOS
this 
is 
particularly 
evident 
where 
funding 
to 
agencies 
depends 
on 
clients 
served
EOS
this 
may 
involve 
developing 
life 
plans 
with 
the 
individuals 
for 
whom 
they 
are 
responsible 
in 
isolation 
from 
other 
agencies
EOS
with 
so 
many 
players
in 
addition 
to 
the 
most 
important 
one 
the 
young 
person 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
there 
are 
no 
clear 
aims 
for 
the 
transition 
process
EOS
indeed
in 
many 
countries
one 
government 
department 
may 
be 
paying 
huge 
sums 
to 
enable 
those 
with 
disabilities 
to 
become 
employable 
and 
to 
live 
independently 
while 
another 
is 
paying 
out 
larger 
sums 
as 
long 
as 
they 
remain 
dependent 
and 
unemployable
EOS
even 
if 
a 
coordinated 
approach 
to 
transition 
is 
difficult 
to 
achieve 
it 
should 
be 
possible 
for 
all 
concerned 
to 
agree 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
aims 
for 
transition
EOS
the 
oecd/ceri 
programme 
oecd 
1986
has 
identified 
four 
general 
areas

detailed

be 
developed

some

of

some 
first

early 
experiences

remain 
clearly 
in 
my

what 
was 
this 
new

where 
the 
academic 
staff 
all 
taught
but 
many 
of 
them 
were 
not 
teachers

engineers

EOS
our 
college
's 
initial 
provision 
for 
students 
with 
special 
needs
was 
established 
in 
1978 
a 
discrete
course 
for 
students 
with 
moderate 
learning 
difficulties 
or
in 
some

appointed 
to 
teach 
the 
students
who 
was 
later 
to

once 
told 
me 
about 
those 
early 
beginnings 
as 
part 
of 
the 
engineering 
department
based 
in 
a 
hut 
on 
the

EOS
for 
a 
long 
time 
i 
assumed 
she 
was 
joking
but 
not 
only 
was 
i 
wrong
i 
was 
also 
ignorant 
of 
the 
hard 
facts 
of 
life 
about 
the 
value 
of 
students 
with 
special 
needs 
and 
the 
staff 
who 
work 
with 
them
EOS
talking 
to 
colleagues 
from 
other 
establishments 
at 
a 
conference 
some 
years 
later
i 
was 
struck 
by 
the 
similarities 
in 
their 
early 
beginnings 
often 
in 
a 
portacabin 
or 
separate 
annexe 
from 
the 
main 
college 
building
or 
in 
accommodation 
previously 
occupied 
by 
a 
school
EOS
stories 
of 
inferior 
accommodation
equipment 
and 
materials
effectively 
deemed 
to 
be 
good 
enough
for 
students 
with 
special 
needs
seemed 
to 
far 
outweigh 
reports 
of 
a 
stated 
commitment 
for 
those 
students 
being 
backed 
up 
by 
provision 
that 
was 
dignified 
and 
appropriate
EOS
the 
life 
preparation 
course
EOS
in 
1983 
we 
began 
to 
provide 
a 
course 
for 
students 
with 
severe 
learning 
difficulties
EOS
this 
provision 
was 
established 
as 
a 
result 
of 
several 
pressures
not 
least 
of  
all 
parental 
lobbying 
for 
an 
alternative 
option 
to 
adult 
training 
centres
EOS
for 
many 
young 
adults 
with 
severe 
learning 
difficulties 
this 
was 
not 
much 
more 
than 
a 
decade 
after 
they 
became 
entitled

EOS

former

a

it 
began 
as
and 
has 
remained
the

EOS
opportunities 
for 
the 
integration 
of 
students 
were 
present 
from 
the 
beginning
EOS
for

there 
is 
a 
shared 
student 
common

there 
is 
one

as

juke 
box

removed

it 
failed 
to 
show 
a 
profit

the 
vending 
machines
EOS
the 
annexe 
has 
few 
refectory 
facilities
and 
on 
some 
days 
it 
seems 
that 
the 
queue 
for 
the 
coffee 
machine 
snakes 
endlessly 
around 
the 
corridors
EOS
during 
queuing 
periods
there 
have 
been 
occasions 
when 
i 
have 
witnessed 
nursery 
nurse 
students
with 
the 
best 
of 
intentions
helping
life 
preparation 
students
for 
example 
by 
operating 
the 
machine 
for 
them 
or 
by 
allowing
them 
to 
jump 
the 
queue
EOS
i 
have 
to 
admit 
that
in 
the 
early 
days
it 
was 
with 
mixed 
feelings 
that 
i 
intervened 
suggesting
for 
example
that 
life 
preparation 
students 
really 
ought 
to 
take 
their 
turn 
the 
same 
as 
anyone 
else
EOS
the 
mixed 
feelings 
were
perhaps
a 
little 
cowardly 
on 
my 
part
EOS
while 
i 
saw 
no 
justification 
for 
positive 
discrimination 
in 
the 
coffee 
queue
i 
was 
aware 
that 
prejudice 
can 
stem 
from 
the 
most 
unexpected 
beginnings
EOS
something 
as 
innocuous 
as 
suggesting 
to 
another 
student 
that 
a 
life 
preparation 
student 
should 
be 
allowed 
to 
take 
the 
coins 
out 
of

purse 
unaided 
may
inadvertently
upset

however
in 
the 
long 
term
i 
feel 
sure 
that 
continuing

formal

informal

nurse

only 
serve

truly 
integrated 
teaching 
sessions
and 
freshly 
inspired 
by 
a 
successful 
joint
activity 
weekend 
at 
a 
local 
outward 
bound 
centre
we 
made 
plans 
to 
change 
the 
structure 
of 
one 
particular 
curriculum 
area
EOS
it 
was 
decided 
that 
a 
double 
staffed 
session 
of 
craft
with 
one 
group 
of 
life 
preparation 
students 
and 
one 
group 
of 
nursery 
nurse 
students 
would 
be 
on 
the 
timetable 
once 
a 
week
EOS
the 
nursery 
nurses 
were 
initially 
given 
a 
talk 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
what 
was
in 
essence
a 
pilot 
scheme 
for 
functional 
integration
EOS
it 
was 
explained 
that 
it 
was 
hoped 
that 
they 
would 
befriend
a 
life 
preparation 
student 
for 
craft 
sessions
working 
alongside 
each 
other 
on 
a 
variety 
of 
projects
EOS
the 
projects 
were 
pitched 
at 
different 
levels
so 
that 
in 
the 
strictest 
sense 
the 
students 
were 
working 
in 
a 
parallel 
fashion
EOS
although 
this 
pilot 
was 
not 
monitored 
formally
it 
was 
hailed 
by 
participating 
students 
and 
staff 
as 
an 
unreserved 
success
generating 
a 
substantial 
commitment 
to 
equality 
for 
students 
with 
severe 
learning 
difficulties
and 
a 
sound 
knowledge
on 
a 
practical 
level
of 
many 
of 
their 
needs
EOS
one 
unexpected 
spin-off 
was 
the 
growth 
of 
a 
few 
genuine 
friendships
EOS
the 
increase 
in 
confidence 
in 
many 
of 
the 
life 
preparation 
students 
was 
another 
benefit
EOS
flushed 
with 
success 
we 
repeated 
this 
timetabled 
session
with 
the 
original 
members 
of 
staff
the 
following 
year 
with 
different 
students
EOS
the 
results 
were 
disappointing
EOS
with 
hindsight
there 
were 
rumblings
from 
some 
nursery 
nurses 
during 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
the 
course
but 
the 
matter 
only 
came 
to 
a 
head 
when 
a 
small 
group 
of 
nursery 
nurses 
made 
a 
formal 
complaint 
to 
a 
course 
tutor
EOS
they 
felt 
that 
they 
were 
not 
getting 
on
with 
their 
craft 
work 
or 
were 
held 
back 
by 
the 
students 
with 
severe 
learning 
difficulties
EOS
the 
outcome 
was 
that 
a 
second 
room 
was 
negotiated 
and 
the 
students 
returned 
to 
the 
pattern 
of 
separate 
and 
segregated 
groups
EOS
during 
a 
further 
meeting 
about 
the 
problems
some 
of 
the 
nursery 
nurse 
staff 
expressed 
their 
concern 
over 
the 
attitude 
of 
this 
group 
of 
students
EOS
they 
felt 
that 
their 
students 
are 
in 
the 
caring 
field 
and 
ought 
naturally 
to 
empathise 
with 
students 
with 
severe 
learning 
difficulties
EOS
i 
would 
question 
this
as 
i 
feel 
we 
are 
treading 
on 
dangerous 
ground 
if 
we 
even 
contemplate 
trying 
to 
impose 
our 
values 
in 
this 
way
however 
strongly 
we 
feel 
personally
EOS
it 
seems 
obvious 
to 
me 
now 
that 
several 
factors 
involved 
could 
have 
been 
given 
more 
thought
EOS
there 
could 
have 
been 
greater 
consultation 
with 
both 
nursery 
nurse 
and 
life 
preparation 
students 
and 
due 
consideration 
given 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
completed 
craft 
projects 
are 
an 
important 
part 
of 
a 
nursery 
nurse
's 
final 
assessment
EOS
we 
now 
have 
an 
opportunity 
to 
benefit 
from 
lessons 
learned
as
during 
the 
past 
year
we 
have 
undertaken 
a 
pilot 
scheme 
to 
integrate 
life 
preparation 
students 
with 
sports 
and 
leisure 
students 
who 
are 
following 
a 
city 
and 
guilds 
course
EOS
feeling 
established
EOS
our 
life 
preparation 
student 
numbers 
have 
grown 
continually 
and 
encompassed 
students 
from 
outside 
the 
district 
as 
happens 
on 
other 
such 
courses
EOS
this 
was 
partly 
because 
our 
college
's 
provision 
for 
students 
with 
severe 
learning 
difficulties 
was 
being 
recommended 
by 
careers 
officers 
from 
other 
authorities
EOS
a 
pat 
on 
the 
back
EOS
it 
felt 
like 
confirmation 
that 
we 
had 
got 
it 
right
EOS
this 
seemed 
to 
be 
further 
corroborated 
when 
we 
were 
invited 
to 
join 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
a 
research 
project 
being 
undertaken 
by 
the 
national 
foundation 
for 
educational 
research 
and 
the 
further 
education 
unit
EOS
other 
colleagues 
working 
in 
schools 
or 
adult 
training 
centres 
from 
our 
authority 
were 
also 
asked 
to 
participate
as 
together 
we 
had 
previously 
set 
up 
a 
voluntary 
curriculum 
development 
group 
to 
look 
at 
authority-wide 
provision 
for 
young 
people 
and 
adults 
with 
severe 
learning 
difficulties
EOS
this  
group 
had 
met 
almost 
every 
week 
for 
nearly 
two 
years
EOS
the 
national 
research 
project 
resulted 
in 
the 
publication 
of 
new 
directions

curriculum 
principles
EOS
from 
the 
very 
beginnings 
of 
the 
life 
preparation
course
we 
tried 
to 
write 
an 
independence 
curriculum
and 
to 
follow 
the 
principles 
of 
normalisation
EOS
every 
opportunity 
to 
maximise 
the 
differences 
between 
school 
and 
college 
life 
was 
seized
EOS
for 
instance
the 
college 
day 
for 
life 
preparation 
students 
is 
the 
same 
length 
as 
for 
other 
students
EOS
the 
possibilities 
for 
integration
that 
do 
not 
exist 
in 
a 
segregated
all-age 
special 
school
are 
many 
as 
students 
begin 
to 
mix
sometimes 
for 
the 
first 
time
in 
a 
community 
setting 
with 
other 
adult 
learners
EOS
the 
college 
environment 
may 
offer 
less 
protection
than 
their 
school
but 
it 
offers 
the 
chance 
to 
broaden 
horizons
EOS
one 
example 
of 
this 
is 
in 
the 
chance 
to 
meet 
and 
work 
with 
non 
special 
needs
staff
EOS
students 
have 
the 
opportunity 
to 
join 
the 
college 
library 
and 
are 
encouraged 
to 
join

they 
are 
given 
a 
copy 
of 
their 
own 
group
's 
timetable
whether 
or 
not 
they 
can 
read
and 
they 
are 
timetabled 
in 
a 
variety 
of 
rooms
with 
different 
tutors 
on 
two 
different 
sites
EOS

on

we 
have 
a 
college 
minibus

can 
book

regular

activities
such 
as 
the 
leisure 
centre
EOS
supervisory 
duties 
at 
break 
and 
lunch-time 
are 
carried 
out 
by

EOS
in 
general
the 
staff/student 
ratio 
is 
rarely 
as 
good 
as 
in 
a 
school 
for 
children 
and 
young 
people 
with 
severe 
learning 
difficulties
EOS
however
as 
our 
special 
needs 
coordinator 
rightly 
emphasises 
we 
are 
a 
college 
not 
an 
extended 
special 
school
EOS
the 
whole 
ethos 
of 
a 
college 
of 
further 
education 
is 
different 
to 
that 
of 
a 
special 
school 
from 
the 
funding 
and 
the 
staffing 
to 
the 
size 
and 
complexity 
of 
the 
sites
EOS
we 
share 
the 
annexe 
base 
with 
nursery 
nurse 
students 
and 
staff
EOS
an 
early 
rule 
of 
thumb 
became 
if 
the 
nursery 
nurses 
do
n't 
do 
it
neither 
do 
we
EOS
we 
talked 
with 
our 
students 
about 
the 
freedoms 
of 
college 
life
and 
suggested 
that 
they 
might 
judge 
whether 
or 
not 
certain 
behaviour 
was 
age 
appropriate
by 
looking 
at 
the 
nursery 
nurses 
incorrectly 
and 
naÃ¯vely 
assuming 
the 
latter 
would 
unfailingly 
provide 
the 
models 
we 
sought
EOS
this 
mechanism 
ended 
in 
total 
failure 
when
after 
lengthy 
and 
various 
attempts 
to 
persuade 
several 
female 
life 
preparation 
students 
to 
give 
up 
wearing 
white 
ankle 
socks 
in 
favour 
of 
tights
short 
socks
mostly 
white
suddenly 
became 
very 
fashionable 
and 
seemed 
to 
adorn 
every 
other 
pair 
of 
ankles 
in 
the 
building
EOS
with 
hindsight
i 
question 
some 
of 
my 
early 
motives 
and 
certainly 
now 
see 
different 
ways 
of 
exploring 
choices 
with 
students
EOS
one 
route 
for 
beginning 
to 
make 
informed 
choices 
is 
through 
self-advocacy
where 
students 
are 
encouraged 
either 
to 
speak 
up 
for 
themselves 
or 
to 
use 
an 
advocate 
who 
speaks 
on 
their 
behalf
EOS
self-advocacy 
complements 
normalisation
and 
it 
is 
an 
issue 
which
recently
staff 
have 
actively 
begun 
to 
promote
EOS
the

selection 
procedures
EOS
at 
present
we 
select 
students 
for 
the 
life 
preparation 
course
following 
a 
baseline 
assessment 
devised 
by 
myself 
and 
colleagues 
which 
is 
carried 
out 
during 
a 
links 
week 
when 
potential 
students 
attend 
college 
full 
time
EOS
we 
did
n't 
have 
interviews
but 
a 
young 
person 
had 
to 
gain' 
a 
place 
none 
the 
less
as 
we 
had 
criteria 
for 
entry 
onto 
the 
course
EOS
i 
suppose 
i 
felt 
that 
this 
fitted 
in 
neatly 
with 
the 
selection 
process 
for 
other 
students
EOS
also
we 
had 
no 
medical
back-up
as 
is 
often 
the 
case 
in 
special 
schools
therefore 
we 
felt 
unable 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
students 
with 
profound 
multiple 
disabilities
EOS
i 
can 
recall 
talking 
to

about 
her 
teaching 
experience 
in 
south 
thames 
college 
and 
her 
approach

for

EOS
when 
she 
spoke 
about 
learning 
difficulties 
or 
special 
needs 
she 
included 
everyone
even 
young 
people 
with 
severe 
challenging 
behaviour
EOS
this 
represented 
a 
very 
different 
target 
group 
to 
the 
one 
with 
which 
i 
was 
familiar
and 
it 
seemed 
an 
alien 
approach 
to 
me
EOS
i 
was 
worried 
that 
it 
could 
dilute 
or 
blunt 
our 
provision
EOS
i 
thought 
that 
it 
undermined 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
getting 
a 
place 
in 
college
for 
students 
with 
severe 
learning 
difficulties
EOS
however
i 
now 
realise 
that 
perhaps 
the 
only 
person 
who 
felt 
intimidated 
by 
fe 
for 
all
was 
me
EOS
our 
selection 
procedure 
has 
resulted 
in 
no 
places 
being 
offered 
to 
students 
with 
profound 
or

disabilities

severe 
challenging 
behaviour
EOS
our 
selection 
procedure 
still 
exists
but 
i 
want 
to 
see 
it 
changed 
to 
one 
which 
is 
more 
equitable

national 
reflections 
currently 
focus 
upon 
the

gain

EOS
in 
considering 
the 
issue 
of 
entitlement 
to 
access
my 
college 
would 
be 
required 
to 
look 
at 
two 
groups 
of 
learners 
hitherto 
excluded 
students 
with 
profound 
or 
multiple 
disabilities 
and 
students 
with 
challenging 
behaviour
EOS
the 
life 
preparation 
course
in 
its 
present 
form
is 
unlikely 
to 
meet 
their 
specific 
needs
but 
the 
curricular 
content 
could 
serve 
as 
a 
starting 
point 
for 
designing 
new 
provision 
which 
would
EOS
the 
possible 
stumbling 
blocks 
would 
be 
financial 
and 
attitudinal 
barriers 
to 
these 
learners
EOS
it 
is 
my 
belief 
that 
our 
life 
preparation 
students 
are 
not 
valued
by 
many 
colleagues
so 
how 
would 
they 
react 
to 
learners 
seen 
to 
be 
less 
able
or 
more 
difficult 
to 
cope 
with
EOS
countering 
obstacles 
to 
inclusion
EOS
there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
issues 
which 
still 
concern 
me 
about 
continuing 
education 
for 
students 
with 
disabilities
just 
as 
they 
did 
when 
i 
entered 
college 
life 
for 
example
the 
fear 
and 
ignorance 
that 
often 
surrounds 
this 
seemingly 
homogeneous 
condition 
known 
as 
disability
and 
the 
unmitigated 
prejudice 
and 
stereotyping 
of 
people 
who 
do 
not 
fit
into 
a 
mythical 
category 
commonly  
known 
as 
normal
EOS
however
i 
hope 
i 
am 
not 
so 
complacent 
that 
i 
am 
unable 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
difficulties 
of 
trying 
to 
bring 
about 
change

it 
is 
a 
lengthy 
and 
wearing 
process

to 
challenge

exhibit 
prejudice

faced 
with 
the 
possibility

reality

encountering 
people

both 
a 
responsibility

intrinsic 
to

i 
believe

to 
be 
valued 
as 
people

any 
establishment 
that 
implies 
this 
on

put

unfortunately
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
just 
insert 
the 
word 
disability
into

the

however
the

range

an

introduction
EOS
elizabeth

moved 
into 
their 
own 
basement 
flat 
in 
an 
inner-city 
suburb 
in 
1987. 
they 
are 
middle-aged 
and 
spent 
nearly 
thirty 
years 
together 
at 
the 
same 
mental 
handicap 
hospital 
but 
lived 
separately 
for 
the 
two 
years 
before 
the 
move 
into 
the 
community 
because 
helen 
was 
transferred 
to 
a 
smaller 
institution
EOS
the 
move 
was 
part 
of 
the

cut

she 
was

frightened

professional 
advice

elizabeth

unhappiness

support 
workers
who 
were 
highly 
motivated

that 
the 
demands

the 
basic

the

segregate

what

something

shown 
that 
the 
favourite 
way

to 
abuse 
its

is
to 
exclude

along

their

EOS
the 
catholic 
church

the 
soviet

under

ways

advocated 
different 
theological

the

are 
not

merely 
disinterested

have 
become 
so 
through

through 
the 
sheer 
amount 
of

they 
spend 
with

the 
excluded 
social

are 
the 
best 
example
though 
not 
the 
only 
possible 
one
EOS
i 
put 
the 
word 
in 
inverted 
commas 
to 
highlight 
a 
mystique 
about 
parenthood
EOS
there 
is 
no 
reason 
why 
having 
some 
coincidental 
sperm-and-egg 
relationship 
with 
a

should 
entitle 
someone 
for 
that 
reason

be 
seen 
as 
a 
natural 
expert
as 
distinct 
from 
a 
very 
clever
highly 
qualified 
one
EOS
but 
if 
criteria 
for 
inclusion

exclusion 
are 
not 
technical 
and 
professional 
but 
based 
on 
a 
philosophy 
about 
what 
human 
beings 
are

parental 
expertise 
can
not 
be 
different 
in 
kind 
from 
that 
of 
professional 
unnatural
experts
EOS
as 
one 
of 
the

are

you 
get

'll

really 
important

conversely

not 
all

most

a 
world-view

you 
may 
expect

include 
their

fully 
paid-up

this 
observation

occasionally 
even 
found

it

easy 
to 
miss 
its 
full 
significance

out

that 
what

define

severe

my 
opening

reflections

arise 
directly 
from 
a 
piece 
of 
research
EOS
between 
1987

1989 
i 
conducted 
in-depth 
interviews 
with 
nearly 
forty 
parents 
of 
children 
with 
trisomy 
21 
so-called 
down
's 
syndrome
who 
were 
between 
the 
ages 
of 
2 
and 
7
EOS
i 
had 
several 
interviews 
with 
each 
parent 
individually
speaking 
to 
nearly 
90 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
total 
population 
group 
in 
a 
borough 
with 
a 
wide 
class 
distribution 
and 
a 
large 
ethnic 
minority 
population

before 
i 
began 
the 
formal 
research 
i 
had 
been 
aware 
from 
the 
few 
parents 
of 
children 
with 
trisomy 
21 
i 
knew 
that 
there 
was 
more 
disquiet 
about 
their 
negotiations 
with 
professionals 
and 
the 
treatment 
of 
their 
children 
than 
had 
made 
its 
way 
into 
the 
academic 
and 
professional 
literature 
on 
parents 
and 
families
EOS
second
i 
also 
knew 
that 
this 
disquiet 
existed 
alongside 
other 
more 
conventional 
attitudes 
which 
perfectly 
fitted 
the 
portrayal 
of 
parents 
usually 
found 
in 
that 
literature
EOS
after 
beginning 
to 
interview 
people 
in 
depth
i 
realised 
that
to 
explain 
this 
juxtaposition 
of 
apparently 
contradictory 
values 
within  
individuals
i 
needed 
to 
go 
beyond 
the 
conceptual 
framework 
set 
by 
clinicians 
and 
sociologists 
alike
EOS
a 
shared 
language 
between 
parents 
and 
professionals 
did 
not 
necessarily 
mean 
shared 
attitudes
EOS
it 
may 
be 
that 
when 
we 
express 
our 
opinions
we 
only 
have 
available 
to 
us 
ready-made 
sets 
of 
ideas
discourses
other 
people
's 
words 
which 
we 
choose 
from
string 
together 
in 
different 
ways 
and 
think 
mistakenly
to 
be 
our 
own
these 
include 
expert
ideas 
and 
the 
colloquial
common-sense 
versions 
of 
them 
absorbed 
by 
ordinary 
people 
in 
one 
way 
or 
another
EOS
but 
we 
have 
something 
else 
too 
which 
is 
genuinely 
our 
own
even 
though 
we 
do
n't 
choose 
it
and 
that 
is 
experience
EOS
it 
became 
clear 
from 
talking 
to 
parents 
that 
i 
had 
to 
see 
how 
what 
they 
said 
actually 
hooked 
up 
with 
their 
experience
the 
fine 
detail 
of 
it
and 
not 
to 
assume 
that 
i 
knew 
exactly 
what 
kind 
of 
lived 
experience 
lay 
behind 
a 
familiar 
form 
of 
words
EOS
parents 
as 
truth 
tellers
EOS
even 
in 
order 
to 
get 
this 
far
i 
had 
to 
believe 
that 
what 
i 
was 
being 
told 
by 
people 
about 
their 
experiences 
and 
feelings 
was 
the 
truth
or 
essentially 
the 
truth
EOS
i 
may 
have 
been 
wrong 
proportionately 
as 
many 
times 
as 
the 
result 
of 
an 
amniocentesis 
turns 
out 
to 
have 
been 
wrong
that 
is
being 
wrong 
in 
both 
cases 
amounts 
to 
a 
hypothetical 
possibility
but 
is 
not 
normal
EOS
i 
decided
for 
example
that 
if 
a 
parent 
told 
me 
they 
had 
dreamt 
about 
having 
a 
down
's 
baby
before 
the 
birth 
in 
the 
medical 
literature
this 
is 
a 
classic 
after-the-event 
self-deception 
they 
had 
in 
fact 
had 
such 
a 
dream
EOS
if 
they 
said 
they 
had 
not 
been 
upset 
on 
being 
told 
the 
diagnosis
this 
actually 
was 
the 
case
they 
were 
not 
suffering 
from 
amnesia
EOS
if 
they 
became 
angry 
at 
things 
said 
to 
them 
by 
professionals
as 
a 
majority 
of 
them 
did 
at 
some 
point
the 
horrifying 
causes 
of 
their 
anger 
were 
true
and 
were 
not 
projections 
of 
their 
own 
distress 
on 
to 
the 
professional 
concerned
EOS
to 
accept 
the 
truth 
of 
these 
accounts 
is 
a 
simple 
but 
giant 
step
and 
one 
which 
the 
academic 
and 
professional 
community 
is 
by 
its 
own 
self-definition 
incapable 
of 
taking
a 
social 
group 
which 
bases 
its 
very 
existence 
on 
its 
own 
claims 
to 
cleverness 
would 
risk 
its 
life 
if 
it 
opened 
even 
one 
ear 
to 
the 
voices 
of 
fools 
and 
heretics
especially 
when 
the 
topic 
itself 
is 
about 
foolishness 
in 
the 
form 
of 
learning 
difficulties
EOS
in 
what 
follows

have 
used 
my

counterpoint

judgement

that 
is 
what 
dead 
people 
experience
if 
the 
dead 
have 
experiences
EOS
for 
bernadette
it
's 
amusing
EOS
from 
this 
paediatrician
's 
reaction
it 
seems 
as 
if 
the 
clinical 
notion 
of 
deep 
shock 
as 
a 
natural 
reaction 
is 
itself 
a 
projection 
of 
that 
professional
's 
anxiety 
on 
to 
the 
parent
EOS
pat 
he 
was 
six 
months 
old 
and 
i
'd 
gone 
down 
for 
his 
second 
immunisation 
and 
i 
mean 
the 
doctor 
i 
went 
to 
see 
was 
a 
family 
doctor 
i
've 
known 
him 
since 
i 
was 
a 
baby 
and 
he 
just
he 
was 
looking 
at 
him 
and 
he 
just 
said
is 
your 
husband 
chinese
EOS
and 
i 
said
no
EOS
and 
he 
just 
stuck 
the 
needle 
in 
his 
arm
and 
he 
said
well
i 
think 
the 
baby
's 
a 
mongol
and 
he 
showed 
me 
the 
door 
and 
that 
was 
it
EOS
he 
was
n't 
looking 
at 
me
EOS
he 
was 
kind 
of 
looking 
down 
and 
twiddling 
his 
pen
you 
know
and 
i 
mean 
i 
know 
it 
sounds 
stupid
but 
i 
did
n't 
mind
i 
think 
i 
knew 
anyway
EOS
i 
mean 
when 
he 
was 
born 
they 
laid 
him 
on 
me
he
'd 
had 
the 
cord 
round 
his 
neck 
three 
times 
and 
he 
looked 
like 
a 
tortoise 
with 
his 
long 
neck 
and 
this 
little 
tiny 
head 
laughs
EOS
and 
i 
thought 
blimey
he
's 
a 
mongol
you 
know
when 
you
're 
looking 
at 
them
and 
then 
i 
was 
looking 
at 
the 
nurses 
and 
waiting 
for 
everyone 
to 
say 
something
and 
nobody 
said 
nothing
EOS
and 
then 
i 
thought
i 
could
n't 
say 
here
is 
this 
baby 
a 
mongol
in 
front 
of 
stan
i 
think 
he 
would 
have 
fell 
over
EOS
pat 
has 
reasons 
not 
to 
mind
EOS
the 
baby 
is 
already 
six 
months 
old
and 
she 
has 
already 
made 
the 
diagnosis 
herself
at 
birth
EOS
in 
addition
both 
her 
own 
parents 
had 
considerable 
physical 
disabilities
EOS
both 
she 
and 
bernadette 
have 
realised 
beforehand 
that 
the 
boundaries 
of 
human 
experience 
are 
wider 
than 
those 
indicated 
in 
the 
mothercare 
catalogue
EOS
what 
about 
those 
who 
have
n't
EOS
rita 
well 
the 
doctor 
was 
crying
she 
had 
tears 
in 
her 
eyes
and 
she 
said
we
've 
got 
some 
news
EOS
and 
then 
the 
stupid 
thing
the 
doctor 
said 
to 
me
does 
she 
look 
like 
anybody 
in 
your 
family
EOS
i 
said
well 
you 
do
n't 
have 
to 
tell 
me
i 
know 
she
's 
a 
mongol
EOS
she 
said
oh 
you 
a 
nurse
EOS
i 
said
no
i 
can 
just 
tell 
by 
her 
face
EOS
so 
i 
went 
back 
and 
see 
the 
baby 
in 
the 
incubator 
and 
then 
i 
went 
back 
to 
the 
ward
EOS
none 
of 
the 
nurses 
spoke 
to 
me
nothing
till 
2 
o'clock 
that 
afternoon
which 
i
'd 
had 
her 
at 
7.30 
in 
the 
morning
EOS
yeah
yeah
well 
i 
completely 
rejected 
her
EOS
as 
soon 
as 
i 
knew 
she 
was
n't 
a 
hundred 
per 
cent
i 
just 
did
n't 
want 
to 
know 
her
EOS
the 
exact 
feelings
EOS
i 
wanted 
her 
to 
die
EOS
and 
i
'll 
tell 
you 
the 
only 
reason 
i 
took 
the 
baby 
home 
was 
because 
martin 
wanted 
her
EOS
now 
this 
looks 
more 
like 
it
a 
normal
natural 
reaction
even 
if 
i 
do 
have 
to 
search 
through 
several 
of 
the 
transcripts 
on 
my 
desk 
to 
find 
one
EOS
natural
does 
this 
mean 
that 
we 
all 
have 
a 
gene 
that 
determines 
we 
will 
be 
shocked
EOS
in 
the 
clinical 
literature
the 
word 
natural
is 
left 
undefined 
the 
medical 
description 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
shock 
goes 
back 
to 
the 
nineteenth-century 
discovery 
of 
hysteria
and 
its 
symptoms 
in 
women
EOS
rita
however
takes 
care 
to 
define 
it
and 
is 
aware 
of 
the 
surrounding 
social 
circumstances
EOS
the 
baby 
had 
been 
taken 
away 
immediately 
and 
wired 
up 
in 
an 
incubator 
for 
three 
days
EOS
since 
rita 
has 
been 
sent 
to 
coventry
she 
has 
not 
been 
told 
that 
it 
is 
physically 
possible 
for 
her 
to 
open 
up 
the 
incubator 
herself 
and 
put 
her 
hands 
in
EOS
eventually 
a 
nurse 
does 
show 
her
and 
then 
once 
i
'd 
touched 
her
she 
was 
mine
EOS
she 
is 
further 
handicapped 
by 
having 
a 
sister-in-law 
a 
nurse 
herself
who 
visits 
immediately 
after 
the 
diagnosis 
has 
been 
made 
and 
starts 
discussing 
fostering 
and 
adoption 
procedures
EOS
most 
importantly
rita
just 
as 
she 
makes 
her 
own 
diagnosis
knows 
unlike 
the 
professionals 
exactly 
what 
the 
shock
is 
and 
that 
it 
comes 
from 
somewhere
EOS
rita 
you 
know
the 
old 
story
my 
first 
thoughts 
when 
i 
had 
her
well 
one 
of 
my 
first 
thoughts
was 
oh
i
've 
got 
one 
of 
them 
kids 
that 
have 
silly 
haircuts
silly 
anoraks
spend 
all 
day 
on 
buses 
or 
all 
day 
in 
a 
home
weaving 
baskets
and 
that 
was 
my 
first 
thought
EOS
i 
do
n't 
know
i 
always 
said 
i
'd 
never 
took 
the 
piss 
out 
of 
these 
children
but 
i
'm 
sure 
i 
must 
have 
done 
at 
school
but 
i 
must 
admit 
i 
was 
embarrassed
EOS
i 
was 
embarrassed 
giving 
birth 
to 
a 
mongol
EOS
if 
we 
was 
educated 
with 
handicapped
you 
know
if 
we
'd 
mixed 
with 
them
but 
we 
never 
saw 
them
EOS
i
'd 
never 
spoken 
to 
one 
till 
we 
had 
louise
you 
know
which 
is 
not 
fair 
on 
us 
normal 
people
EOS
they
're 
anti-social
handicapped 
people
and 
they
're 
kept 
that 
way
EOS
they
're 
all 
at 
a 
different 
school 
all 
day
and 
they 
shop 
at 
different 
times
but 
you 
never 
see 
them 
in 
restaurants 
and 
why 
should
n't 
they 
be
EOS
they
're 
just 
there 
you 
know
EOS
like 
many 
of 
the 
parents
rita 
readily 
agrees 
with 
the 
professional 
maxim 
that 
it
's 
natural 
to 
feel 
shocked
but 
she 
clearly 
does 
not 
take 
this 
to 
be 
some 
scientific 
and 
objective 
concomitant 
of 
the 
situation
something 
in 
her 
genes
EOS
such 
parents 
know 
that 
it 
is 
something 
they 
have 
been 
socialised 
into 
by 
a 
segregated 
society
and 
that 
things 
could 
have 
been 
otherwise
that 
they 
ought 
to 
be 
otherwise 
it
's 
not 
fair
EOS
between 
the 
apparent 
extremes 
of 
these 
examples 
lie 
all 
sorts 
of 
individual 
circumstances
EOS
some 
parents
' 
reaction 
to 
the 
diagnosis 
is 
nullified 
by 
the 
additional 
diagnosis 
of 
some 
life-threatening 
physical 
condition 
such 
as 
meningitis 
or 
a 
heart 
defect
which 
to 
them 
is 
more 
distressing
EOS
some 
may 
have 
previously 
had 
a 
miscarriage 
or 
an 
infant 
who 
died
EOS
for 
others 
who 
went 
through 
distress
over 
and 
over 
again 
the 
concrete 
feelings 
behind 
the 
abstraction 
of 
shock
have 
to 
do
not 
with 
newly 
existent 
beings 
whom 
one 
does
n't 
know
but 
with 
existing 
people 
in 
one
's 
life 
partners
family
etc
EOS
and 
none 
of 
them 
fails 
to 
recognise 
where 
these 
negative 
feelings 
come 
from
that 
such 
feelings 
have 
been  
taught 
by 
a 
particular 
upbringing 
and 
environment
EOS
shock
and 
trauma
must 
be 
seen 
as 
an 
example 
of 
what 
psychologists 
call 
reification
sets 
of 
concrete 
interpersonal 
and 
societal 
relationships 
are 
turned 
into 
an 
abstract 
thing
which 
dominates 
our 
language 
and 
hence 
our 
way 
of 
thinking
EOS
this 
self-perpetuating 
process 
of 
mystification 
that 
denies 
real 
feelings 
and 
experiences 
is 
a 
necessary 
prop 
to 
the 
status
power 
and 
basic 
philosophical 
values 
of 
a 
way 
of 
life
the 
teaching 
of 
negative 
feelings 
must 
go 
on
EOS
what 
needs 
to 
be 
emphasised
though
is 
that 
direct 
experience 
becoming 
part 
of 
a 
way 
of 
life 
that 
includes 
the 
alien 
in 
a 
wider 
definition 
of 
what 
it 
is 
to 
be 
human 
seems 
to 
be 
almost 
the 
only 
way 
of 
achieving 
demystification
EOS
brian
the 
only 
problem 
i 
had 
was 
people 
thinking 
i 
had 
problems
EOS
coming 
to 
terms
whose 
and 
what 
terms
EOS
for 
many 
parents 
it 
is 
as 
though 
the 
child 
they 
were 
expecting 
is 
dead
EOS
many 
doctors 
think 
that 
it 
is 
important 
for 
parents 
to 
recognize 
these 
feelings 
and 
to 
go 
through 
a 
period 
of 
mourning 
for 
their 
lost 
imaginary 
baby
EOS
these 
feelings
may 
diminish 
in 
time 
so 
that 
the 
parent 
can 
come 
to 
terms 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
baby 
has 
down
's 
syndrome

a 
couple 
of 
hours 
after

receive 
a 
call

a 
local

asking 
advice

a

tells

just 
going 
through 
the 
process

grieving 
for 
the 
child 
she

months 
old
the 
health 
visitor
's 
instruction 
in 
the 
art

no

antenatal

talk

i 
said

my

when 
i 
was 
pregnant
what 
if 
i 
have 
a 
handicapped 
baby
EOS

he 
said 
he 
would
n't

it 
was 
in 
the 
pretext

it 
would 
never

you
've

you
're

another

what 
you

much 
they

the

attach

totally 
opposite

many

can 
put 
their

incident

they 
experienced

when 
the 
paediatrician 
come

he 
only 
was 
in

two 
seconds
he 
looked 
her 
up 
and 
said 
typical 
mongol
either 
typical 
mongol 
features

typical 
mongol 
face
it 
was 
one 
of 
the 
two 
he 
said

i 
could 
have 
killed 
him

they 
put 
jenny 
phil

in 
a 
grotty 
old 
side

that 
she 
did
n't 
upset

no

come 
in

tell

i 
grabbed 
one 
of 
the 
midwives
the 
senior 
one 
there

i 
said 
to 
her
what 
happens 
now

reiterated 
that 
they 
would 
like 
becky 
to 
stay 
in

jenny 
could 
come 
home

becky 
was 
a 
bit 
jaundiced 
you 
see

i 
said 
what 
happens 
if 
she 
had
n't 
had 
down
's 
syndrome
they 
said 
she 
could 
have 
gone

's 
it
wrap 
her 
up
we
're 
going

bottle

champagne
the 
best 
you

it 
was 
just 
like 
we
'd 
had 
a 
baby

i 
mean 
i
'd 
had 
a 
sort 
of 
cry

at 
the

time 
i 
was 
glad 
i 
had 
a 
daughter

two 
sons

after 
he 
said 
typical 
mongol
i

i 
do
n't 
know
it
's 
awkward 
to 
explain
everything 
seemed 
to 
fall 
into 
place
EOS
just 
as 
the 
clinical 
professions 
can 
provide 
parents 
with 
the 
language 
and 
the 
concepts 
with 
which 
to 
take 
a 
negative 
view 
of 
the 
child

they 
can 
provide 
the 
unwitting 
stimulus 
for 
the 
parent 
to 
enter 
a 
new
positive 
world 
in 
which 
things 
fall 
into 
place

helen 
for 
some 
reason 
i 
thought 
of 
it

they
've 
given 
me 
this 
monster 
of 
a 
baby 
that 
i 
was
n't 
going 
to 
be 
able 
to 
love
and 
some 
woman 
came 
round 
she 
may 
have 
been 
the 
hospital 
social 
worker 
or 
an 
almoner 
and 
spent 
about 
an 
hour 
telling 
me 
how 
this 
was 
going 
to 
completely 
change 
the 
course 
of 
my 
life
i 
was 
going 
to 
be 
saddled 
with 
this 
child 
that 
would 
need 
twenty-four 
hour 
care 
and 
attention
and 
i 
had 
to 
think 
carefully 
about 
whether 
i 
wanted 
that 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
my 
life
i.e. 
was 
i 
going 
to 
keep 
him 
virtually 
talking 
me 
into 
not 
keeping 
him
and 
i 
think 
the 
turning-point 
was 
that 
i 
felt 
there 
was 
something 
coming 
from 
the 
outside 
that 
was
sort 
of
really 
trying 
to 
urge 
me 
to 
reject 
him
and 
that 
i 
rebelled 
against 
it
EOS
so 
that 
i 
ca
n't 
say 
i 
had 
any 
positive 
feelings 
in 
the 
first 
place
but 
the 
realisation 
that 
everybody 
else 
had 
negative 
feelings 
made 
me 
love 
him
EOS
the 
majority 
of 
parents 
reported 
being 
presented 
covertly 
or 
overtly 
with 
an 
opt-out 
clause 
when 
the 
diagnosis 
was 
first 
made
often 
couched 
in 
terms 
of
leave  
the 
baby 
here 
for 
a 
couple 
of 
days
go 
home 
and 
think 
about 
it
it
being 
unspecified
EOS
cunningham 
1982
reports 
that 
if 
parents 
decide 
to 
give 
up 
the 
baby 
permanently
it 
is 
for 
the 
parents 
who 
make 
it
the 
right 
decision
EOS
it 
is 
important 
to 
note 
here 
than 
even 
if 
a 
parent 
is 
gripped 
by 
those 
negative 
fantasies 
that 
the 
textbooks 
claim 
to 
be 
real 
and 
universal
she 
is 
also 
immediately 
capable 
of 
embracing 
a 
critique 
of 
the 
values 
she 
is 
confronted 
with
EOS
perhaps 
we 
are 
now 
in 
a 
position 
to 
give
from 
a 
parental 
perspective
an 
alternative 
interpretation 
of 
what 
exactly 
it 
means 
to 
come 
to 
terms 
with
a 
child
's 
disability
EOS
for 
the 
clinical 
and 
educational 
professions 
and 
the 
lay 
notions 
which 
derive 
their 
values 
from 
them
their 
very 
practice 
makes 
it 
clear 
what 
fact 
it 
is 
that 
you 
come 
to 
terms
with
you 
have 
not 
given 
birth 
to 
a 
member 
of 
the 
human 
species 
as 
we 
define 
it
and 
to 
which 
we 
allocate 
certain 
rights 
and 
social 
roles
but 
to 
an 
object 
of 
pathology 
a 
monster
to 
use 
a 
technical 
term 
employed 
in 
medical 
anatomy
EOS
for 
the 
parent
the 
same 
phrase 
means 
the 
inverse
i 
have 
not 
given 
birth 
to 
the 
monster 
which 
my 
upbringing 
and 
socialisation 
led 
me 
to 
believe 
i
'd 
had
but 
to 
a 
normal 
member 
of 
the 
human 
species 
as 
i 
now 
define 
it
EOS
this 
widening 
definition 
of 
what 
it 
is 
to 
be 
human
couched 
in 
sociologically 
aware 
terms
runs 
throughout 
the 
responses
and 
is 
further 
expressed 
in 
attitudes 
to 
amniocentesis 
and 
abortion 
in 
subsequent 
pregnancies
EOS
in 
medical 
practice
and 
especially 
in 
medical 
economics
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
the 
identification 
of 
a 
foetus 
with 
a 
disability 
by 
amniocentesis 
cvs
will 
inevitably 
lead 
to 
an 
abortion
EOS
yet
only 
a 
small 
proportion 
of 
the 
parents 
interviewed 
would 
even 
contemplate 
termination 
of 
a 
subsequent 
pregnancy 
should 
a 
test 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
positive
EOS
some 
who 
had 
subsequent 
pregnancies 
had 
refused 
any 
kind 
of 
test
despite 
in 
some 
cases 
being 
aggressively 
pressurised 
by 
the 
hospital
EOS
others 
had 
undergone 
a 
test 
because 
they 
needed 
to 
know
not 
because 
they 
had 
any 
intention 
of 
terminating
EOS
even 
where 
doubts 
are 
expressed 
about 
having 
another 
one
they 
are 
stated 
in 
terms 
which 
imply 
a 
criticism 
of 
social 
arrangements 
rather 
than 
in 
terms 
of 
personal 
coping
EOS

EOS
similarly
cosmetic 
surgery 
is 
seen 
in 
the 
professional 
literature 
as 
an 
option 
some 
parents 
choose 
it
some 
do
n't
or 
even 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
cure
especially 
by 
the 
surgeons 
contracted 
to 
perform 
it
whose 
understanding 
of 
the 
issues 
extends 
as 
far 
as 
the 
principle 
that 
if 
people 
see 
a 
physically 
normal 
child 
they 
will 
react 
to 
it 
normally
and 
will 
elicit 
normal 
behaviour
EOS
no 
doubt 
cosmetic 
surgery 
is 
performed
even 
encouraged
EOS
in 
this 
sample
however
not 
one 
parent 
wanted 
it 
for 
their 
own 
child
and 
in 
general 
they 
were 
more 
prescriptive 
about 
what 
was 
morally 
correct 
for 
other 
parents 
here 
than 
on 
any 
other 
issue
EOS
pat 
the 
surgeons 
are 
god
anyway
are
n't 
they
EOS
i 
mean 
it 
was 
like 
years

i  
heard 
things 
about 
down

children

holes 
in 
the 
heart

why 
bother 
to 
do 
it
but 
now 
everything
's 
changing 
let's 
make 
them 
more 
normal
EOS
but 
why 
do 
that
EOS
i 
mean 
they
're 
normal 
to 
us 
but 
they
're 
not 
normal 
to 
other 
people
so 
why 
should 
we 
make 
them 
normal 
to 
them
just 
to 
please 
society
EOS
i 
mean 
the 
world
's 
made 
up 
of 
all 
different 
coloured 
people 
why 
should
n't 
we 
have 
different 
faces 
and 
all
EOS
if 
we 
all 
walked 
round 
with 
the 
same 
face 
and 
same 
coloured 
skin 
it 
would 
be 
pretty 
boring
would
n't 
it
EOS
the 
world 
of 
normality 
is 
redefined
EOS
no 
longer 
a 
matter 
of 
distribution 
across 
a 
norm
of 
statistics 
and 
probability
normality
itself 
is 
simply 
a 
common-sense
inclusive 
definition 
of 
what 
it 
is 
to 
be 
human

wider 
boundaries

why

using

set 
alongside

i 
am 
saying 
that  
we 
are 
confronted
beneath 
a 
language 
which 
is 
often 
common 
to 
both 
parties
with 
two 
competing 
moral 
philosophies

that 
the 
language 
of 
partnership

a 
mirage
a 
deliberate 
and 
partisan 
disguise 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
one 
of 
those 
philosophies 
holds 
power 
while 
the 
other 
comes 
from

there

there 
is 
a 
strange 
tribe

believes 
in

psychometric 
assessments

incantations

a 
tribe 
of 
what 
beverley
devon

the 
beauty

that

everyone

become 
black

a

anyone 
can 
join 
the 
real

they 
may 
be 
parents

they 
may 
only

letters

what 
they 
have 
in 
common 
is 
this
they 
know 
that 
intellectual 
perfection

the 
criteria 
for 
measuring 
it 
are 
chimeras
EOS
in

this

dangerous
subversive

no

be 
dealt 
with

such
EOS
the 
best 
way 
of 
dealing 
with 
it
perhaps
is 
to 
draw 
parents 
into 
a 
prevailing 
set 
of 
values 
about 
intelligence

humanity

the 
grounds

my 
involvement 
with 
the 
family
EOS
a 
long-standing 
friendship 
with 
an 
asian 
family 
who 
were 
neighbours 
of 
mine 
led 
to 
my 
being 
involved 
in 
the 
process 
of 
statementing 
their 
youngest 
child
balbinder 
singh
EOS
he 
was 
6 
years 
old 
and 
had 
been 
at 
the 
school 
for 
three 
terms 
when 
the 
head
knowing 
that 
i 
was 
a 
neighbour 
and 
friend 
of 
balbinder
's 
mother
invited 
me 
to 
go 
with 
mrs 
singh 
to 
a 
meeting 
with 
the 
educational 
psychologist
EOS
the 
head 
explained 
that 
he 
and 
the 
class 
teacher 
felt 
that 
balbinder 
was 
making 
little 
progress 
and 
they 
were 
worried 
about 
his 
lack 
of 
concentration 
and 
poor 
language
EOS
they 
were 
considering 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
place 
in 
a 
special 
school 
for 
children 
with 
moderate 
learning 
difficulties 
which 
could 
offer 
smaller 
classes 
and 
more 
individual 
attention
EOS
his 
transfer 
would 
involve 
a 
lengthy 
and 
complicated 
assessment 
procedure
and 
they 
wanted 
me 
to 
help 
to 
explain 
this 
to 
balbinder
's 
parents 
and 
to 
reassure 
them
EOS
this 
chapter 
is 
an 
account 
of 
the 
process 
and 
is 
an 
attempt 
to 
see 
it 
from 
the 
family
's 
perspective
EOS
i 
had 
known 
the 
family 
for 
some 
years 
as 
i 
had 
been 
mrs 
singh
's 
english 
tutor 
on 
a 
local 
authority 
adult 
literacy 
programme
EOS
balbinder 
was 
3 
years 
old 
when 
i 
first 
started 
visiting 
the 
house
a 
very 
sociable 
child 
who 
eagerly 
awaited 
my 
arrival 
and 
the 
chance 
to 
play 
with 
the 
bag 
of 
toys 
i 
always 
brought 
with 
me
EOS
over 
the 
years
in 
my 
role 
as 
home 
tutor 
to 
his 
mother
i 
had 
had 
a 
privileged 
relationship 
with 
balbinder 
and 
his 
family
EOS
by 
the 
time 
he 
started 
school 
i 
had 
already 
been 
an 
intermediary 
between 
the 
family 
and 
the 
town 
hall
the 
dhss
the 
local 
social 
services
the 
medical 
profession 
and 
school
EOS
mr 
and 
mrs 
singh 
kept 
most 
of 
their 
official 
correspondence 
between 
the 
pages 
of 
their 
telephone 
directory 
and 
on 
my 
weekly 
visits 
we 
sorted 
out 
the 
milk 
tokens
rates 
demands
post 
office 
giros
all 
of 
which 
made 
linguistic 
demands 
which 
were 
beyond 
the 
level 
of 
their 
competence
EOS
mr 
singh
a 
kenyan 
asian
confessed 
to 
me
after 
i 
had 
been 
a 
friend 
of 
the 
family 
for 
several 
years
that 
he 
was 
neither 
fluent 
in 
swahili
the 
language 
of 
his 
education 
up 
to 
13
nor 
in 
punjabi
his 
mother 
tongue
EOS
however
the 
family 
spoke 
punjabi 
exclusively 
at 
home 
and 
had 
very 
strong 
views 
on 
the 
need 
to 
do 
this
EOS
they 
were 
concerned 
that 
the 
boys 
should 
not 
lose 
touch 
with 
their 
language 
and 
culture
EOS
the 
two 
older 
boys
aged 
5 
and 
7
were 
competent 
in 
both 
languages
EOS
balbinder 
seemed 
slower 
to 
talk 
and 
his 
mother 
was 
worried 
about 
his 
reluctance 
to 
speak 
english
EOS
as 
both 
parents 
spoke 
to 
him 
in 
punjabi 
for 
most 
of 
the 
time 
this 
did 
not 
seem 
surprising
EOS
i 
reassured 
mrs 
singh 
that 
once 
he 
started 
playgroup 
there 
would 
be 
an 
improvement
EOS
in 
fact 
the 
health 
visitor 
diagnosed 
a 
problem 
with 
speech 
at 
his 
screening 
at 
age 
3
and 
he 
began 
attending 
the 
local 
health 
clinic 
for 
speech 
therapy
EOS
mrs 
singh 
mentioned 
this 
once 
or 
twice 
but 
did 
not 
seem 
to 
set 
much 
store 
by 
it
EOS
she 
continued 
to 
express 
concern 
at 
what 
she 
felt 
to 
be 
his 
backwardness 
at 
speaking 
english
EOS
i 
wondered 
how 
many 
people 
he 
had 
the 
opportunity 
to 
speak 
to 
outside 
his 
family
EOS
however
the 
playgroup 
run 
by 
local 
parents 
had 
not 
been 
the 
success 
for 
balbinder 
that 
we 
had 
hoped
EOS
there 
were 
complaints 
about 
his 
behaviour
EOS
he 
did 
not 
seem 
to 
know 
how 
to 
play
would 
not 
settle 
down
ran 
about 
too 
much 
and 
fought 
with 
the 
other 
children
EOS
at 
home
whenever 
i 
visited
he 
always 
seemed 
the 
same 
docile
attractive 
child 
sitting 
silently 
watching 
tv 
in 
the 
impeccably 
tidy 
and 
attractive 
furnished 
living 
room 
of 
the 
very 
small
terraced 
house
EOS
in 
the 
house
the 
lives 
of 
the 
three 
young 
boys 
seemed 
quiet
calm 
and 
disciplined
EOS
but 
the 
large 
hall 
at 
playgroup
the 
number 
of 
activities
different 
experiences 
and 
other 
children 
seemed 
to 
produce 
excitable 
and 
often 
aggressive 
behaviour 
in 
balbinder
EOS
the 
staff 
were 
also 
worried 
about 
his 
speech
not 
seeming 
to 
take 
into 
account 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
was 
the 
first 
time 
he 
had 
come 
out 
of 
a 
punjabi-speaking 
environment 
and 
was 
having 
to 
cope 
with 
new 
experiences 
in 
a 
foreign 
language
EOS
his 
mother
's 
fluent
though 
inaccurate
english 
and 
confident 
manner 
may 
have 
led 
them 
to 
expect 
more 
of 
him
EOS
mrs 
singh 
worried 
about 
him 
a 
great 
deal
and 
was 
often 
very 
angry 
at 
his 
apparent 
lack 
of 
progress
EOS
she 
wanted 
him 
to 
learn 
to 
count
begin 
to 
write
and 
above 
all 
to 
speak 
english
EOS
she 
and 
the 
children 
visited 
my 
house 
regularly 
at 
this 
period
so 
that 
i 
could 
hear 
the 
oldest 
boy
ravi
read
EOS
he 
had 
already 
overtaken 
his 
mother 
and 
she 
did 
not 
know 
how 
to 
cope 
with 
the 
graded 
readers 
he 
brought 
home 
from 
school 
or 
his 
teacher
's 
request 
that 
she 
should 
hear 
him 
read
EOS
whenever 
they 
visited 
me 
i 
listened 
to 
him 
reading
EOS
he 
was 
quite 
fluent 
but 
seemed 
to 
read 
without 
comprehension
EOS
i 
felt 
that 
the 
texts 
he 
was 
reading 
did 
not 
speak 
of 
familiar 
experiences 
or 
vocabulary
EOS
i 
remember 
him 
struggling 
with 
a 
story 
where 
understanding 
of 
the 
narrative 
depended 
on 
the 
reader 
knowing 
about 
canals
EOS
he 
could 
read 
the  
words 
canal
lock
barge 
but 
the 
illustrations 
of 
an 
urban 
canal 
with 
tall
industrial 
buildings 
and 
long 
painted 
boats 
portrayed 
an 
unknown 
landscape
EOS
at 
8 
he 
was 
rapidly 
becoming 
a 
non-reader
EOS
the 
idea 
that 
reading 
might 
be 
for 
pleasure 
had 
not 
occurred 
to 
him
EOS
balbinder 
was 
always 
pleased 
to 
come 
along 
for 
these 
sessions
to 
play 
with 
my 
children
's 
toys 
and 
run 
in 
the 
garden
EOS
mrs 
singh 
brought 
her 
letters 
and 
forms 
for 
me 
to 
elucidate
EOS
i 
was 
constantly 
surprised 
at 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
she 
needed 
explanations 
for 
even 
the 
most 
taken-for-granted 
aspects 
of 
junior 
school 
life
EOS
the 
list 
of 
clothing 
for 
a 
school 
trip 
included 
night-dress
and 
sponge-bag
EOS
the 
singh 
children 
slept 
in 
their 
underpants
and 
she 
wondered 
whether 
i 
could 
lend 
her 
a 
night-dress
for 
ravi 
and 
also 
a 
sponge
EOS
almost 
all 
documents 
sent 
home 
from 
school 
were 
incomprehensible
EOS
letters 
inviting 
parents 
to 
join 
the 
parent 
teacher 
association
visit 
the 
spring 
fayre
to 
volunteer 
for 
parent-governor 
elections
or 
attend 
a 
maths 
workshop
were 
put 
in 
the 
bin 
after 
my 
attempts 
to 
explain 
them
EOS
schools 
unwittingly 
erect 
a 
language 
barrier 
which 
must 
exclude 
great 
numbers 
of 
parents
EOS
end 
of 
term 
reports 
contained 
phrases 
like 
his 
development 
of 
spatial 
awareness
or 
his 
confidence 
on 
the 
apparatus
EOS
however 
phrases 
like 
is 
working 
hard
always 
tries 
his 
best
is 
beginning 
to 
show 
some 
improvement
did 
not 
fool 
her
EOS
she 
interpreted 
them 
quite 
accurately 
to 
mean 
that 
her 
children 
were 
under-achieving 
and 
the 
message 
she 
took 
from 
them 
was 
almost 
always 
a 
negative 
one
EOS
on 
one 
occasion 
mrs 
singh 
had 
asked 
me 
to 
go 
with 
her 
to 
visit 
one 
of 
the 
boy
's 
teachers
EOS
the 
teacher 
was 
brusque 
and 
busy
EOS
she 
brushed 
aside 
mrs 
singh
's 
assertions 
that 
her 
son 
was 
not 
making 
progress 
by 
telling 
her 
repeatedly 
that 
it 
was 
unreasonable 
to 
expect 
anything 
more
she 
used 
phrases 
like 
he 
is 
well 
below 
average
he 
is 
slow
he 
is 
in 
the 
bottom 
set
you 
must 
accept 
that
EOS
you 
ca
n't 
put 
it 
there 
if 
it
's 
not 
there
EOS
mrs 
singh 
was 
not 
satisfied
EOS
she 
wanted 
to 
know 
why 
he 
never 
brought 
anything 
home
why 
he 
had 
no 
reading 
book
EOS
his 
teacher 
explained 
that 
homework 
for 
8 
year 
olds 
was 
not 
school 
policy 
and 
jeetinder 
was 
called 
in 
to 
show 
his 
mother 
that 
he 
could 
read
EOS
he 
produced 
his 
reading 
book
one 
of 
the 
pirate 
series
by 
sheila 
mccullagh
and 
read 
quite 
fluently
EOS
the 
teacher 
suggested 
that 
mrs 
singh 
could 
help 
by 
reading 
with 
him
mrs 
singh 
to 
read 
one 
line
jeetinder 
the 
next
she 
was 
evidently 
unaware 
of 
the 
possibility 
that 
jeetinder
's 
reading 
could 
be 
more 
competent 
than 
his 
mother
's
EOS
looking 
at 
a 
piece 
of 
work 
on 
the 
board 
mrs 
singh 
said 
she 
wanted 
her 
son 
to 
write 
like 
that
EOS
the 
teacher
by 
now 
worn 
down 
by 
mrs 
singh
's 
refusal 
to 
accept 
jeetinder
's 
limitations
told 
her 
that 
it 
had 
been 
written 
by 
a 
highly 
intelligent 
girl
EOS
she 
continued 
to 
try 
to 
convince 
mrs 
singh 
that 
although 
jeetinder 
was 
in 
the 
bottom 
set 
he 
was 
doing 
well 
and 
was 
not 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
bottom 
set
EOS
none 
of 
this 
convinced 
mrs 
singh 
who 
left 
the 
classroom 
saying 
in 
an 
unusually 
dictatorial 
tone 
to 
the 
class 
teacher
i 
want 
you 
to 
sort 
him 
out 
and 
bring 
homework 
home
EOS
later
i 
tried 
to 
mollify 
her 
by 
pointing 
out 
that 
the 
teacher 
had 
said 
what 
a 
nice 
boy 
he 
was
EOS
looking 
me 
straight 
in 
the 
eye 
she 
replied
nice

the 
school
's 
educational 
psychologist 
had 
made 
contact 
with 
the 
family

he 
had 
been 
involved 
in 
an 
assessment 
of 
jeetinder
the 
second 
son
now 
in 
the 
fourth 
year 
at 
the 
school
EOS
there 
had 
been 
concern 
about 
his 
progress 
at 
the 
same 
stage 
as 
there 
now 
was 
for 
balbinder
's
EOS
mrs 
singh 
had 
been 
visited 
at 
home 
and 
the 
head 
had 
arranged 
for 
me 
to 
be 
present 
so 
that 
i 
could 
explain 
and 
reinforce 
any 
suggestions
EOS
in 
the 
event
i 
found 
this 
difficult 
as 
they 
seemed 
inappropriate
EOS
the 
psychologist 
had 
suggested 
among 
other 
things 
that 
mrs 
singh 
could 
help 
to 
improve 
jeetinder
's 
spoken 
and 
written 
language 
by 
reading 
to 
him 
at 
bedtime 
and 
could 
help 
to 
improve 
his 
numeracy 
by 
encouraging 
him 
to 
spend 
and 
account 
for 
his 
pocket 
money
EOS
both 
ideas 
were 
culturally 
alien 
to 
mrs 
singh
EOS
there 
were 
no 
english 
children
's 
books 
in 
the 
house
and 
the 
boys 
did 
not 
shop 
on 
their 
own 
nor 
have 
regular 
pocket 
money
EOS
neither 
parent 
was 
fully 
literate 
in 
english 
or 
their 
mother 
tongue
EOS
mrs 
singh 
had 
seemed 
mystified 
by 
the 
advice
as 
she 
believed 
the 
school 
should 
be 
responsible 
for 
progress 
in 
english 
and 
mathematics 
and 
shrugged 
helplessly 
when 
i 
suggested 
that 
parents 
also 
had 
an 
important 
role
EOS
the 
statements 
process 
for 
balbinder
EOS
my 
contact 
with 
the 
family 
had 
lapsed 
for 
a 
while 
when 
the 
head 
asked 
to 
see 
me 
to 
request 
help 
in 
explaining 
the 
statementing 
procedures 
to 
mrs 
singh
EOS
the 
head 
told 
me 
that 
mrs 
singh 
had 
been 
coming 
to 
school 
regularly 
to 
express 
concern 
about 
balbinder
's 
lack 
of 
progress
EOS
the 
class 
teacher 
and 
the 
head 
were 
also 
worried
they 
felt 
that
after 
four 
terms 
at 
school
he 
is 
the 
slowest 
in 
the 
class
EOS
their 
concern 
was 
that 
in 
september
when 
he 
should 
be 
moving 
into 
the 
second 
year 
infants 
with 
his 
age 
cohort
he 
would 
be 
far 
behind
EOS
the 
head 
had 
asked 
the 
educational 
psychologist 
to 
come 
and 
assess 
him 
with 
a 
view 
to 
producing 
a 
formal 
statement 
of 
special 
educational 
needs
EOS
standardised 
tests 
had 
shown 
that 
whereas 
his 
two 
older 
brothers 
had 
scored 
better 
on 
verbal 
ability 
than 
on 
visual 
motor 
ability
balbinder 
had 
performed 
equally 
poorly 
on 
both
EOS
as 
a 
result 
the 
educational 
psychologist 
had 
been 
investigating 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
place 
at 
a 
local 
special 
school 
for 
balbinder
EOS
they 
now 
wanted 
to 
explain 
all 
this 
to 
mrs 
singh 
and 
hoped 
that 
i 
would 
be 
able 
to 
explain 
the 
implications 
of 
what 
they 
were 
going 
to 
say
EOS
the 
same 
morning 
mrs 
singh 
had 
approached 
me 
in 
the 
school 
foyer
handed 
me 
a 
bag 
full 
of 
letters
and 
burst 
into 
tears
EOS
i 
realised 
that 
i 
had
n't 
visited 
her 
for 
some 
weeks 
and 
agreed 
to 
go 
to 
her 
house

school
EOS
as 
an 
outside 
observer

into 
the 
statementing

had 
a 
neutral 
but 
not 
disinterested 
role

i 
kept 
a 
diary 
of 
events

attempted 
to 
chart 
the 
process 
by 
which 
6-year-old 
balbinder 
was 
removed 
from 
mainstream 
education

that

was 
not 
making 
much 
progress 
and 
that 
because 
of 
class 
sizes 
he 
would 
be 
unlikely 
to 
receive 
the 
kind 
of 
attention 
he 
needed
EOS
he 
explained 
that 
at 
cedars 
the 
local 
authority
's 
school 
for 
children 
with 
learning 
difficulties
where 
classes 
are 
small 
and 
the 
teachers 
are 
specialists 
at 
coping 
with 
balbinder
's 
sort 
of 
problems
he 
might 
do 
better
EOS
he 
stressed 
that 
it 
was 
essential 
for 
balbinder 
to 
start 
at 
cedars 
as 
soon 
as 
possible
if 
he 
was 
going 
to 
catch 
up
EOS
he 
seemed 
to 
be 
suggesting 
that 
once 
balbinder 
had 
been 
at 
cedars 
for 
a 
while
he 
might 
be 
capable 
of 
re-entering 
mainstream 
education 
at 
middle 
school 
transfer
EOS
this 
was 
an 
idea 
she 
was 
to 
hold 
on 
to 
throughout 
the 
process
EOS
both 
the 
head 
and 
the 
educational 
psychologist 
stressed 
the 
positive 
value 
of 
cedars 
and 
the 
likely 
problems 
for 
balbinder 
if 
he 
stayed 
on 
at 
his 
present 
school
which 
they 
told 
her 
did 
not 
have 
the 
expertise 
to 
cope 
with 
his 
needs
EOS
by 
suggesting 
this 
they 
began 
quite 
unwittingly 
to 
undermine 
her 
confidence 
in 
the 
school 
and 
in 
herself
EOS
she 
became 
very 
upset 
and 
confused
clearly 
feeling 
that 
balbinder
's 
failure 
was 
her 
fault
EOS
she 
cried 
a 
lot 
repeatedly 
saying 
he 
always 
wants 
to 
play
he 
just 
wants 
toys
EOS
when 
she 
was 
calmer
she 
also 
made 
it 
clear 
that 
she 
felt 
that 
a 
stricter 
approach 
that 
forced 
balbinder 
to 
concentrate 
and 
work 
harder 
was 
all 
that 
was 
needed
EOS
she 
felt 
that 
he 
was 
not 
doing 
well 
because 
he 
was 
not 
trying 
hard 
enough
and 
that 
his 
teachers 
were 
not 
making 
him 
try 
hard 
enough
EOS
she 
listened 
intently 
as 
they 
explained 
the 
statementing 
procedure
EOS
they 
stressed 
that 
the 
decision 
to 
send 
balbinder 
to 
cedars 
would 
be 
made 
by 
mrs 
singh 
and 
her 
husband
EOS
the 
first 
stage 
would 
be 
to 
visit 
the 
school 
and 
then 
return 
to 
discuss 
the 
matter 
again
EOS
a 
date 
was 
arranged 
for 
the 
following 
week 
for 
both 
events 
and 
i 
agreed 
to 
go 
with 
them
EOS
what 
i 
did 
not 
realise 
at 
the 
time
but 
discovered 
later
was 
that 
mrs 
singh 
had 
no 
idea 
that 
transfer 
next 
september 
had 
been 
suggested 
she 
expected 
that 
it 
would 
happen 
straight 
away
EOS
after 
she 
had 
left
the 
head 
and 
educational 
psychologist 
explained 
the 
statementing 
procedure 
in 
more 
detail
EOS
in 
the 
past 
they 
had 
waited 
until 
after 
the 
school 
screening 
tests 
at 
7-plus 
but 
felt 
that 
this 
was 
leaving 
it 
too 
late
EOS
in 
balbinder
's 
case 
it 
was 
not 
simply 
that 
he 
was 
a 
slow 
learner
EOS
there 
were 
what 
the 
head 
called 
social 
concerns
behind 
his 
transfer
EOS
he 
was 
developing 
self-control 
in 
the 
classroom
but 
found 
it 
harder 
on 
the 
playground 
where 
it 
seemed 
that 
he 
was 
easily 
influenced 
by 
other 
children 
to 
behave 
badly
EOS
as 
he 
put 
it
he 
reverts 
when 
he 
is 
with 
naughty 
children
EOS
they 
had 
not 
given 
these 
reasons 
for 
transfer 
to 
his 
parents
EOS
yet 
they 
were 
clearly 
important 
considerations 
as 
far 
as 
the 
school 
was 
concerned
EOS
it 
was 
not 
a 
foregone 
conclusion 
that 
there 
would 
be 
a 
place 
available 
at 
cedars 
since 
there 
is 
a 
lot 
of 
pressure 
on 
special 
school 
places 
in 
the 
county
EOS
as 
the 
head 
of 
cedars 
was 
making 
his 
entry 
list 
for 
september 
already
and 
would 
have 
to 
submit 
it 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
week
the 
educational 
psychologist 
was 
going 
to 
request 
a 
place 
for 
balbinder 
before 
statementing 
him
EOS
thus 
it 
was 
essential 
to 
get 
mr 
and 
mrs 
singh
's 
agreement 
as 
soon 
as 
possible
EOS
later 
on 
the 
same 
day
i 
visited 
mr 
and 
mrs 
singh 
at 
home
EOS
over 
tea 
and 
food 
we 
talked 
about 
the 
school
's 
suggestion
EOS
mrs 
singh 
was 
upset
she 
felt 
rejected 
by 
the 
school 
her 
children 
had 
been 
attending 
for 
five 
years
EOS
she 
was 
depressed 
and 
angry 
with 
balbinder
EOS
she 
had 
been 
crying 
and 
said 
that 
she 
had 
been 
feeling 
awful
all 
day
EOS
she 
clearly 
found 
it 
hard 
to 
sort 
out 
the 
implications 
of 
what 
was 
being 
suggested
EOS
however 
we 
agreed 
to 
visit 
cedars 
together 
in 
a 
few 
days
' 
time
EOS
the 
difficulty 
she 
was 
having 
in 
making 
sense 
of 
the 
boys
' 
education 
was 
illustrated 
by 
the 
packet 
of 
letters 
she 
had 
brought 
to 
school 
in 
the 
morning
EOS
one 
from 
the 
lea 
was 
about 
her 
8-year-old 
son
's 
transfer 
to 
middle 
school
an 
event 
generating 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
paper 
including 
a 
list 
of 
the 
available 
schools
another 
letter 
from 
the 
lea 
explained 
parents
' 
rights 
of 
choice 
and 
appeal
also 
dates 
of 
open 
evenings
yet 
another 
letter 
from 
the 
school 
to 
which 
he 
had 
been 
allocated 
required 
the 
parents 
to 
sign 
the 
tear-off 
slip 
and 
return 
it 
to 
their 
present 
school
EOS
fortunately
i 
noticed 
that 
he 
had 
been 
given 
a 
place 
at 
a 
different 
school 
from 
his 
older 
brother 
and 
that 
it 
was 
actually 
a 
matter 
of 
filling 
in 
the 
appeal 
form 
requesting 
a 
place 
at 
another 
school
EOS
i 
suggested 
that 
they 
should 
also 
accept 
the 
invitation 
to 
take 
him 
to 
visit 
his 
new 
school
's 
open 
evening
EOS
mrs 
singh 
said 
she 
would 
go 
if 
i 
came 
too 
but 
not 
otherwise
EOS
another 
letter 
from 
the 
middle 
school 
was 
about 
a 
visiting 
theatre 
group 
and 
asked 
for 
money 
as 
well 
as 
a 
tear-off 
slip
EOS
we 
discussed 
with 
her 
10-year-old 
son 
whether 
he 
wanted 
to 
see 
the 
play 
and 
we 
put 
the 
money 
for 
a 
ticket 
in 
an 
envelope
EOS
to 
his 
chagrin 
we 
threw 
away 
the 
letter 
about 
a 
skiing 
holiday
EOS
at 
nearly 
Â£400 
for 
a 
week 
in 
austria 
his 
parents 
were 
not 
interested
EOS
in 
the 
evening 
i 
consulted 
a 
friend 
who 
is 
also 
a 
local 
head 
teacher
EOS
her 
school 
has 
a 
high 
proportion 
of 
ethnic 
minority 
children 
where 
i 
felt 
balbinder 
might 
not 
have 
seemed 
such 
a 
problem
EOS
in 
her 
opinion
it 
was 
unlikely 
that 
he 
would 
get 
a 
place 
at 
cedars 
at 
such 
a 
late 
stage 
in 
the 
year
EOS
she 
also 
felt 
that 
age 
6 
was 
too 
early 
to 
make 
what 
she 
saw 
as 
a 
drastic 
decision 
once 
out 
of 
mainstream 
education 
she 
felt 
he 
would 
be 
unlikely 
to 
get 
back
EOS
at 
this 
stage 
in 
the 
proceedings
my 
own 
feelings 
were 
mixed
EOS
if 
the 
school 
felt 
it 
could 
not 
cope 
with 
balbinder 
then 
maybe 
he 
would 
be 
better 
in 
a 
more 
sympathetic 
environment
EOS
on 
the 
other 
hand 
mrs 
singh 
would 
lose 
all 
her 
social 
contacts 
in 
the 
local 
community 
once 
she 
did 
not 
have 
to 
take 
him 
to 
school 
every 
day
EOS
the 
school 
gave 
her 
a 
point 
of 
reference 
and 
contact 
with 
other 
mothers
EOS
the 
middle 
school 
which 
both 
her 
older 
boys 
attended 
was 
a 
long 
walk 
from 
her 
home 
and 
made 
little 
or 
no 
attempt 
to 
involve 
parents
EOS
if 
balbinder 
was 
bussed 
to 
cedars 
every 
day 
she 
would 
be 
effectively 
cut 
off 
from 
any 
real 
involvement 
in 
her 
children
's 
schooling
and 
from 
an 
important 
part 
of 
her 
own 
role  
within 
the 
community 
as 
the 
mother 
of 
a 
young 
child 
at 
the 
local 
school
EOS
on 
the 
other 
hand 
i 
knew 
that 
her 
confidence 
in 
balbinder
's 
school 
had 
been 
profoundly 
shaken 
by 
the 
interview 
with 
the 
head 
and 
educational 
psychologist
EOS
if 
balbinder 
did
n't 
get 
a 
place 
at 
cedars 
this 
year 
she 
would 
become 
even 
more 
anxious 
about 
his 
progress
EOS
march 
9
visiting 
cedars 
school
EOS
the 
head 
made 
us 
very 
welcome
EOS
he 
began 
by 
talking 
to 
mr 
and 
mrs 
singh 
about 
the 
school
EOS
he 
stressed 
the 
normality 
of 
the 
children 
who 
attended 
it
EOS
he 
explained 
that 
children 
came 
to 
cedars 
when 
their 
own 
school 
could 
not 
give 
them 
the 
individual 
help 
with 
basic 
skills 
which 
they 
needed
EOS
he 
explained 
that 
when 
a 
child 
becomes 
anxious 
he 
or 
she 
may 
stop 
learning
EOS
cedars
he 
told 
them
was 
a 
special 
school 
because 
it 
had 
special 
teachers 
with 
special 
skills 
and 
training
EOS
all 
of 
the 
sixteen 
teachers 
in 
the 
school 
were 
experienced 
in 
teaching 
children 
with 
learning 
difficulties
EOS
another 
special 
feature 
was 
the 
size 
of 
the 
groups
ten 
in 
the 
first 
year
twelve 
in 
the 
second 
and 
fifteen 
thereafter
EOS
balbinder 
would 
be 
in 
a 
group 
with 
ten 
children
EOS
mrs 
singh 
seemed 
to 
be 
listening 
intently 
but 
i 
guess 
that 
a 
lot 
of 
what 
was 
being 
said 
went 
over 
her 
head
EOS
i 
am 
not 
sure 
that 
she 
even 
knows 
the 
word 
special
and 
phrases 
like 
learning 
difficulties
becomes 
anxious
experienced
are 
not 
necessarily 
familiar
EOS
after 
a 
while 
she 
asked
these 
children
do 
they 
learn 
it 
at 
the 
end
EOS
the 
head 
replied 
that 
the 
school 
offered 
ideal 
circumstances 
and 
that 
most 
children 
responded 
positively
EOS
there 
is 
an 
annual 
review 
in 
which 
a 
report 
is 
made 
on 
the 
child
's 
progress
EOS
all 
parents
he 
told 
them
have 
the 
right 
to 
say
i 
want 
my 
child 
to 
leave
and 
he 
said
our 
job 
is 
to 
help 
the 
child 
go 
back
EOS
they 
review 
this 
possibility 
annually 
and 
he 
explained 
that 
when 
they 
have 
identified 
children 
who 
will 
go 
back 
they 
let 
them 
go 
into 
mainstream 
school 
for 
at 
first 
a 
morning 
and 
then 
one 
day 
a 
week
EOS
at 
the 
moment 
six 
children 
would 
be 
going 
back 
into 
middle 
school 
in 
september
EOS
at 
this 
point 
mrs 
singh 
said 
comfortably
they 
have 
learnt
that
's 
nice
EOS
the 
head 
went 
on 
to 
explain 
that 
the 
school
's 
job 
was 
to 
understand 
each 
child
's 
problem
EOS
he 
told 
them 
that 
many 
children 
learned 
more 
slowly
EOS
he 
illustrated 
different 
ways 
in 
which 
reading
for 
example
could 
be 
taught
and 
how 
some 
children 
may 
not 
be 
mature
enough 
to 
cope 
with 
a 
look 
and 
say
approach
or 
may 
not 
develop 
that 
way
EOS
he 
explained 
how 
look 
and 
say
uses 
eyes
while 
phonics 
uses 
ears
EOS
mr 
and 
mrs 
singh 
listened 
politely 
but
possibly
were 
confused 
by 
all 
this 
specialist 
terminology
EOS
he 
went 
on 
to 
tell 
them 
about 
the 
school
EOS
the 
children 
started 
at 
5 
and 
could 
stay 
until 
16
EOS
they 
could 
also 
leave 
at 
any 
time
EOS
each 
part 
of 
the 
school 
lower/ 
middle/upper 
resembled 
mainstream 
school
the 
difference 
lying 
in 
the 
size 
of 
the 
teaching 
group
EOS
at 
16-plus 
they 
go 
on 
to 
college 
for 
up 
to 
two 
years 
and 
follow 
courses 
which 
will 
lead 
to 
work
EOS
several 
of 
the 
15 
year 
olds 
were 
on 
work 
experience 
at 
the 
moment
EOS
he 
then 
took 
us 
round 
the 
school
EOS
the 
lower 
school 
had 
its 
own 
grassed 
and 
paved 
play 
area 
with 
plentiful 
equipment
EOS
the 
rooms 
were 
small
purpose 
built
had 
carpeted 
floors
and 
each 
teacher 
had 
a 
non-teaching 
assistant
EOS
it 
was 
an 
intimate 
small-scale 
non-threatening 
environment
EOS
i 
was 
particularly 
impressed 
by 
the 
art 
room
EOS
the 
workshop 
and 
home 
economics 
area 
were 
also 
impressive
and 
the 
school 
had 
three 
computers
EOS
outside 
was 
very 
pleasant 
with 
views 
over 
open 
fields 
and 
a 
local 
park
EOS
part 
of 
the 
senior 
side 
had 
been 
landscaped 
to 
make 
an 
attractive 
outdoor 
work 
area 
with 
wooden 
table 
and 
benches 
made 
in 
the 
workshop
EOS
there 
was 
a 
swimming 
pool 
and 
a 
distant 
view 
of 
the 
donkey 
field
EOS
there 
seemed 
to 
be 
few 
ethnic 
minority 
children
one 
in 
each 
class 
perhaps
certainly 
none 
in 
the 
youngest 
group
EOS
after 
the 
visit 
the 
head 
talked 
about 
the 
importance 
of 
parental 
involvement
EOS
he 
explained 
that 
regular 
contact 
and 
discussion 
of 
ways 
in 
which 
parents 
can 
help 
at 
home 
was 
vital
together
we 
can 
achieve 
more
EOS
the 
school 
had 
an 
open-door 
policy
EOS
he 
then 
put 
it 
to 
mr 
and 
mrs 
singh 
that 
they 
would 
have 
to 
think 
about 
whether 
they 
would 
like 
balbinder 
to 
come 
to 
the 
school
EOS
he 
explained 
that 
there 
were 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
places
with 
sixteen 
or 
seventeen 
taken 
up 
for 
september 
already 
i 
wondered 
whether 
this 
meant 
balbinder 
might 
be 
unlucky
but 
did 
not 
like 
to 
ask
EOS
he 
explained 
the 
procedure 
by 
which 
balbinder 
would 
be 
given 
a 
place
EOS
the 
educational 
psychologist 
would 
prepare 
notes 
on 
balbinder
EOS
he 
himself 
would 
visit 
balbinder 
at 
his 
present 
school
EOS
he 
stressed
we 
only 
want 
him 
to 
come 
if 
it
's 
right
EOS
nothing 
happens 
until 
you 
say 
yes
EOS
then 
mr 
and 
mrs 
singh 
would 
come 
again 
with 
balbinder
and 
finally 
they 
would 
receive 
a 
letter 
from 
county 
hall
EOS
again
he 
stressed 
that 
the 
final 
decision 
lay 
with 
them
he 
will 
not 
come 
until 
you 
sign 
it
in 
the 
end 
you 
decide
EOS
mr 
singh 
asked 
his 
first 
question
would 
it 
be 
next 
september
EOS
the 
head 
said 
that 
that 
would 
be 
the 
case 
and 
that 
balbinder 
would 
stay 
for 
as 
long 
as 
he 
needed 
their 
help
EOS
however 
they 
could 
make 
the 
decision 
to 
take 
him 
away 
at 
any 
time
EOS
mrs 
singh 
asked 
do 
you 
have 
the 
same 
holiday
and 
then 
spoke 
for 
the 
first 
time 
about 
balbinder
EOS
she 
seemed 
distressed
i 
mean 
balbinder
he 
used 
to 
just 
sit 
by 
the 
telly
even 
now 
he 
still
he 
wants 
toys
he 
does
n't 
want 
to 
do 
the 
things
he 
wants 
to 
do 
all 
the 
time 
what 
he 
wants 
to 
do
EOS
the 
head 
nodded 
reassuringly
seeming 
to 
listen
but 
he 
did 
not 
encourage 
her 
to 
talk 
about 
balbinder 
any 
more
EOS
instead 
he 
went 
on 
to 
tell 
them 
that 
the 
shortest 
time 
they 
kept 
pupils 
was 
for 
two 
years 
but 
that 
usually 
they 
tried 
to 
move 
people 
back 
into 
mainstream 
at 
the 
time 
for 
transfer 
to 
middle/upper 
school
EOS
he 
told 
them 
that 
the 
educational 
psychologist 
was 
very 
good 
and 
really 
knew 
the 
children
EOS
mrs 
singh
still 
pursuing 
her 
own 
thoughts
said
i 
wish 
he 
was 
just 
like 
other 
children
like 
my 
other 
children
EOS
the 
head 
said 
it 
was 
important 
to 
think 
about 
whatever 
is 
best
for 
balbinder
and 
went 
back 
to 
what 
the 
school 
catered 
for 
people 
think 
it
's 
for 
mentally 
handicapped
EOS
it 
does
n't 
look 
like 
one
said 
mrs 
singh 
very 
positively
EOS
the 
head 
told 
them 
that 
there 
were 
many 
different 
special 
schools 
in 
the 
county 
and 
explained 
where 
and 
what 
each 
one  
was 
for
reassuring 
them 
that 
cedars 
is 
a 
school 
for 
children 
who 
have 
difficulty 
getting 
started 
with 
basic 
skills
EOS
its 
job 
is 
to 
help 
children 
who 
are 
struggling
EOS
he 
gave 
mr 
and 
mrs 
singh 
a 
school 
booklet 
and 
saw 
us 
out
EOS
we 
rang 
for 
a 
taxi 
and 
while 
we 
waited
looked 
at 
books 
of 
photographs 
of 
school 
plays
trips
art 
work 
and 
sports 
days
EOS
both 
mr 
and 
mrs 
singh 
seemed 
surprised 
and 
relieved 
by 
the 
normality 
of 
the 
school
EOS
mr 
singh 
told 
me 
that 
one 
of 
his 
brothers-in-law 
had 
told 
them 
it 
was 
a 
school 
for 
mentally 
handicapped
EOS
this 
had 
clearly 
been 
worrying 
them 
both
EOS
when 
we 
got 
home 
i 
could 
see 
that 
they 
were 
ready 
to 
agree 
to 
the 
move
EOS
it 
was 
also 
evident 
that 
they 
had 
not 
weighed 
up 
the 
consequences
EOS
it 
all 
seemed 
easy 
they 
sign 
on 
the 
dotted 
line 
and 
balbinder 
would 
be 
virtually 
taken 
out 
of 
their 
hands
EOS
despite 
the 
school
's 
stated 
intention 
to 
involve 
parents 
as 
far 
as 
possible
i 
seriously 
doubted 
whether 
mr 
or 
mrs 
singh 
would 
be 
capable 
or 
prepared 
to 
enter 
into 
the 
kind 
of 
partnership 
the 
school 
envisaged
EOS
looking 
through 
the 
booklet 
the 
head 
had 
given 
them
i 
guessed 
that 
they 
would 
have 
some 
difficulty 
making 
sense 
of 
it
EOS
they 
would 
probably 
need 
help 
with 
sentences 
like
class 
teachers
together 
with 
the 
help 
of 
the 
remedial 
specialist
ensure 
that 
there 
is 
a 
detailed 
understanding 
of 
the 
learning 
difficulties 
of 
each 
individual 
child
EOS
terms 
like
environmental 
work
a 
full 
curriculum
special 
programmes 
of 
work 
for 
language 
development
would 
need 
to 
be 
explained 
to 
them
EOS
the 
school
's 
expressed 
intention 
is 
that 
parents 
are 
helped 
to 
understand 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
learning 
difficulties 
of 
their 
child 
and 
are 
encouraged 
to 
visit 
the 
school 
frequently 
to 
develop 
that 
understanding 
and 
to 
continue 
that 
approach 
at 
home
EOS
neither 
mr 
nor 
mrs 
singh 
have 
the 
confidence 
to 
take 
on 
such 
a 
role
EOS
march 
12
coping 
with 
the 
procedure
EOS
i 
met 
with 
mrs 
singh 
and 
the 
educational 
psychologist 
in 
the 
head
's 
room
EOS
mrs 
singh 
was 
very 
certain 
she 
and 
her 
husband 
had 
decided 
that 
they 
both 
want 
balbinder 
to 
go 
to 
cedars
EOS
i 
tried 
to 
explore 
the 
problems 
mrs 
singh 
would 
have 
in 
attempting 
to 
be 
a 
fully 
participating 
parent 
but 
the 
educational 
psychologist 
seemed 
to 
feel 
that 
this 
was 
a 
problem 
common 
to 
many 
cedars 
parents
EOS
the 
educational 
psychologist 
spent 
some 
time 
explaining 
the 
legal 
side 
of 
statementing
which 
is 
complex
EOS
he 
told 
us 
that 
it 
would 
take 
many 
weeks 
to 
sort 
out 
and 
would 
involve 
a 
variety 
of 
procedures
such 
as 
a 
medical
reports 
from 
the 
school 
and 
visits
EOS
there 
would 
be 
twenty-nine 
days 
between 
the 
initial 
letter 
from 
county 
hall 
and 
any 
action
EOS
the 
sheer 
amount 
of 
information 
seemed 
daunting
EOS
i 
arranged 
to 
visit 
that 
afternoon 
and 
to 
go 
through 
it 
with 
mr 
and 
mrs 
singh
EOS
when 
i 
arrived 
they 
showed 
me 
the 
letter 
they 
had 
received 
from 
the 
chief 
education 
officer 
that 
morning 
which 
explained 
the 
proposed 
statementing 
procedure
EOS
the 
learning 
difficulties 
being 
experienced 
by 
your 
child 
were 
discussed 
and  
you 
agreed 
that 
your 
child 
probably 
has 
a 
special 
educational 
need 
which 
requires 
further 
investigation
EOS
therefore 
it 
is 
proposed 
to 
carry 
out 
an 
assessment 
of 
your 
child
's 
needs 
under 
the 
education 
act 
1981 
with 
your 
agreement
EOS
the 
letter 
was 
at 
pains 
to 
stress 
the 
parents
' 
involvement 
and 
their 
rights
if 
it 
is 
agreed 
that 
the 
authority 
should 
determine 
the 
special 
educational 
provision 
for 
your 
child
your 
further 
rights 
under 
the 
education 
act 
1981 
will 
be 
explained 
to 
you
EOS
an 
enclosed 
booklet 
gave 
further 
general 
information 
about 
the 
provision 
of 
special 
education 
with 
an 
addendum 
summarising 
the 
legal 
rights 
of 
parents 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
assessment 
process
EOS
in 
this
the 
mysterious 
twenty-nine 
days 
was 
explained
parents 
will 
have 
a 
period 
of 
29 
days 
in 
which 
to 
seek 
further 
information 
from 
the 
chief 
education 
officer 
and 
to 
make 
representations 
and 
submit 
written 
evidence
EOS
since 
they 
had 
evidently 
made 
up 
their 
minds
none 
of 
this 
seemed 
important 
to 
them
EOS
going 
through 
the 
cedars
' 
brochure 
with 
them
however
they 
were 
pleased 
to 
find 
a 
statement 
which 
they 
could 
relate 
to
namely 
that 
the 
school 
sets 
out 
to 
help 
children
who 
are 
having 
problems 
in 
learning 
to 
read
find 
spelling 
and 
writing 
difficult
are 
unable 
to 
express 
themselves 
well
are 
unable 
to 
settle 
and 
concentrate
EOS
all 
these 
seemed 
to 
relate 
to 
balbinder
's 
needs 
as 
his 
parents 
saw 
them 
and 
mr 
and 
mrs 
singh 
were 
beginning 
to 
seem 
happier
EOS
as 
they 
understood 
it
after 
a 
short 
while 
balbinder 
might 
be 
sorted 
out 
and 
returned 
to 
mainstream
EOS
i 
did 
not 
feel 
so 
optimistic
EOS
the 
brochure 
stated 
clearly 
that 
while 
some 
children 
transferred 
back 
to 
mainstream 
schools
the 
majority 
remain 
until 
they 
are 
16 
years 
of 
age

testing
EOS
visited 
mrs 
singh 
at 
home
EOS
she 
told 
me 
that 
she 
had 
been 
present 
when 
balbinder 
was 
tested 
by 
the 
educational 
psychologist
EOS
balbinder 
had 
had 
to 
do 
a 
lot 
of 
puzzles
EOS
the 
psychologist 
had 
said 
he 
was 
good 
with 
his 
hands
EOS
mrs 
singh 
said 
he 
would 
not 
sit 
down 
and 
kept 
walking 
about
EOS
she 
said 
he 
was 
the 
same 
at 
home
only 
wanted 
to 
play 
with 
toys 
and 
watch 
tv
he 
would
n't 
do 
any 
work
EOS
i 
was 
not 
sure 
what 
she 
meant 
by 
work
EOS
she 
went 
on 
to 
her 
worries 
about 
jeetinder 
who 
still 
was
n't 
bringing 
anything 
home 
from 
school
EOS
she 
was 
being 
racially 
harassed 
and 
was 
afraid 
to 
go 
out 
into 
her 
garden
EOS
her 
husband 
was 
away 
in 
india 
for 
three 
weeks
EOS
people 
were 
throwing 
things 
over 
her 
garden 
wall 
and 
someone 
had 
painted 
on 
the 
front 
door
EOS
we 
spent 
a 
lot 
of 
time 
discussing 
this
EOS
in 
some 
ways 
balbinder 
seemed 
the 
least 
of 
her 
problems 
at 
the 
time
EOS
perhaps 
it 
was 
a 
relief 
that 
matters 
were 
being 
taken 
out 
of 
her 
hands
EOS
we 
agreed 
to 
meet 
at 
school 
the 
following 
week
EOS
june 
10
the 
information 
for 
the 
statement
EOS
first
the 
head 
went 
through 
the 
school 
report
details 
of 
birth
address
etc
EOS
there 
was 
a 
brief 
account 
of 
professional 
intervention 
to 
date
EOS
before 
starting 
school 
he 
had 
attended 
the 
child 
development 
centre
received 
speech 
therapy 
and 
since 
had 
been 
seen 
on 
several 
occasions 
by 
the 
educational 
psychologist
EOS
then
there 
was 
a 
description 
of 
the 
child
's 
functioning
he 
had 
taken 
a 
long 
time 
to 
settle 
into 
school
e.g. 
routine 
and 
order 
of 
the 
class
EOS
he 
had 
communication 
problems 
speech 
and 
english 
language 
were 
not 
good
EOS
he 
had 
difficulty 
sounding
because 
of 
this
and 
it 
was 
thought 
to 
be 
affecting 
his 
progress 
in 
learning 
to 
read
EOS
the 
head 
attempted 
to 
explain 
to 
mrs 
singh 
how 
children 
have 
to 
learn 
the 
initial 
sounds 
of 
words 
and 
how 
having 
two 
languages 
can 
impede 
this
EOS
i 
think 
mrs 
singh 
understood
EOS
balbinder 
has 
also 
had 
difficulty 
learning 
colours
numbers 
and 
sounds
EOS
his 
progress 
was 
slow 
because 
his 
retention 
was 
poor
EOS
at 
this 
point 
mrs 
singh 
looking 
concerned 
said
you 
think 
there
's 
something 
wrong 
with 
him 
inside 
of 
him
EOS
the 
head 
said
no
he
's 
not 
ill
EOS
mrs 
singh 
agreed 
that 
it 
must 
be 
the 
way 
he 
forgot 
things
EOS
the 
head 
said 
yes
he 
does 
have 
difficulty 
remembering 
particularly 
sounding
and 
felt 
that 
this 
could 
be 
because 
he 
was 
perhaps 
more 
fluent 
in 
punjabi
EOS
there 
were 
discrepancies 
in 
the 
report
EOS
on 
the 
one 
hand 
mrs 
singh 
was 
told 
that 
his 
drawing 
and 
writing 
were 
immature
that 
he 
was 
still 
drawing 
and 
writing 
like 
a 
very 
young 
child
yet 
later 
she 
was 
told 
that 
he 
was 
very 
good 
with 
a 
pencil 
and 
talented 
at 
art
EOS
having 
said 
that 
he 
was 
very 
immature 
the 
report 
added 
that 
there 
had 
been 
considerable 
improvement
but 
it 
had 
taken 
a 
long 
time 
he 
had 
only 
been 
at 
school 
for 
four 
terms 
and 
had 
had 
a 
change 
of 
teacher
EOS
the 
head 
stressed 
that 
what 
balbinder 
needed 
was 
to 
be 
in 
a 
small 
group
not 
in 
a 
class 
of 
twenty-three
EOS
in 
order 
for 
him 
to 
maintain 
interest 
he 
needed 
to 
work 
in 
short 
spurts
EOS
in 
his 
present 
situation
his 
difficulty 
in 
concentrating 
took 
up 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
teacher
's 
time
EOS
the 
head 
then 
commented 
on 
his 
social 
development
EOS
here 
they 
felt 
there 
had 
been 
much 
progress
EOS
balbinder 
used 
to 
be 
wild
but 
he 
had 
learned 
to 
share 
and 
to 
take 
part 
in 
group 
work
despite 
still 
being 
a 
very 
lively 
child
EOS
the 
head 
then 
went 
on 
to 
describe 
the 
aims 
and 
provision 
of 
special 
education
EOS
since 
balbinder 
clearly 
made 
more 
progress 
in 
a 
small 
group 
where 
he 
could 
have 
a 
lot 
of 
attention
and 
where 
all 
worked 
at 
the 
same 
pace
this 
could 
be 
an 
answer
EOS
the 
head 
felt 
that 
the 
boy 
needed 
somebody 
permanently 
watching 
him
EOS
also 
he 
needed 
a 
lot 
of 
talking 
in 
english
as 
he 
was 
still 
not 
sounding 
words 
clearly
EOS
further 
he 
was 
a 
very 
active 
child
and 
needed 
specialist 
apparatus
EOS
they 
had 
all 
the 
necessary 
facilities 
and 
resources 
at 
cedars
EOS
the 
head 
was 
very 
persuasive
showing 
concern 
for 
the 
way 
balbinder 
would 
react 
when 
or 
if
he 
fell 
behind
EOS
as 
he 
was 
already 
behind 
in 
mastering 
the 
basic 
skills 
which 
lay 
the 
foundation 
for 
all 
further 
work
he 
felt 
that 
balbinder 
needed 
a 
lot 
of 
help 
if 
he 
was 
to 
do 
justice 
to 
his 
abilities
EOS
and 
he 
said 
very 
kindly
that
's 
our 
view 
of 
balbinder
EOS
the 
educational 
psychologist 
gave 
his 
report
EOS
he 
reiterated 
that 
balbinder
's 
problems 
with 
language 
had 
needed 
attention 
before 
school
EOS
he 
stressed 
that 
he 
was 
a 
very 
likeable 
little 
boy
EOS
however
observing 
him 
in 
the 
classroom 
he 
had 
noticed 
his 
immature 
behaviour
EOS
he 
ran 
about 
a 
lot
and 
found 
concentration 
difficult
EOS
despite 
much 
improvement 
in 
pencil 
and 
art 
work 
there 
had 
been 
none 
in 
reading 
and 
other 
school 
work
EOS
he 
was 
fidgety 
and 
in 
a 
dream 
world 
when 
being 
given 
instruction 
in 
a 
group
EOS
often 
he 
watched 
other 
children 
and 
then 
followed 
and 
copied 
them
EOS
the 
psychologist 
commented 
that 
balbinder 
had 
liked 
having 
a 
reading 
book 
and 
clearly 
wanted 
to 
read 
but 
when 
it 
came 
to 
reading 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
what 
he 
was 
doing 
but 
relied 
on 
guessing
EOS
he 
clearly 
wanted 
to 
do 
well
wanted 
to 
read 
but 
needed 
a 
lot 
of 
extra 
help
EOS
when 
asked 
questions 
he 
gave 
one 
word 
answers
though 
he 
used 
two 
words 
on 
occasion
as 
in 
boys 
swimming
wet 
play
EOS
on 
the 
tests 
he 
gave 
him 
he 
was 
better 
on 
puzzles 
and 
patterns
poor 
on 
those 
involving 
speaking 
and 
understanding

he 
felt 
that 
balbinder 
needed 
to 
work 
slowly 
and 
not 
be 
pushed 
he 
needed 
more 
time 
and 
specific 
help 
to 
speak 
in 
sentences

at 
this 
point 
mrs 
singh 
said
they 
are 
not 
allowed 
to 
speak 
english 
at 
home

she 
felt 
that 
he 
spoke 
better 
in 
punjabi

that 
he 
remembered 
better

referred

all 
spoke

found 
this 
very 
odd

at 
the 
weekend

she 
had 
taken 
balbinder 
to 
stay 
with 
his 
grandparents

the

psychologist 
listened 
tolerantly 
to 
mrs 
singh
's 
comments
did 
not 
respond 
to 
them 
but 
simply 
repeated 
that 
balbinder 
needed 
to 
be 
with 
teachers 
who 
were 
experienced 
in 
working 
with 
small 
groups

mrs 
singh 
said 
that 
she 
felt 
that 
balbinder 
would 
always 
do 
what 
was 
wanted 
if 
it 
suited 
him
EOS
the 
educational 
psychologist 
told 
her 
that 
one 
of 
the 
teachers 
from 
cedars 
had 
visited 
balbinder 
in 
school 
and 
made 
very 
positive 
comments
EOS
it 
seemed 
that 
a 
place 
was 
available 
but 
that 
all 
the 
complex 
procedures 
had 
to 
be 
completed 
before 
it 
could 
be 
offered 
to 
them

still 
had

speak

same 
day

services 
would 
write 
to 
mrs

the 
procedure 
was 
necessarily 
long-winded 
but 
it 
could 
be 
completed 
by 
the 
end 
of 
term
EOS
mrs 
singh 
expressed 
a 
worry 
about 
balbinder 
refusing 
to 
dress 
himself 
and 
ordering 
her 
to 
get 
him 
ready 
for 
school 
when 
he 
could 
do 
this 
perfectly 
well 
if 
he 
wanted 
to
EOS
the 
educational 
psychologist 
said 
this 
was 
understandable 
while 
he 
was 
feeling 
rather 
unsettled
EOS
the 
head 
said 
he 
would 
chase 
up 
the 
documents

mrs

seemed 
bewildered 
by 
the 
amount 
of 
information

had 
been

i 
visited 
mr

mrs 
singh
EOS
mrs 
singh 
and 
i 
talked 
mr 
singh 
through 
the 
meeting
point 
by 
point
EOS
he 
agreed 
with 
the 
head
's 
account 
of 
balbinder
's 
lack 
of 
concentration
which 
obviously 
worried 
them 
both 
a 
great 
deal
EOS
he 
listened 
to 
what 
i 
had 
to 
say 
about 
the 
procedure 
still 
to 
be 
gone 
through 
and 
hoped 
that 
they 
would 
soon 
hear 
whether 
balbinder 
had 
a 
place
EOS
i 
said 
that 
this 
was 
almost 
certain 
but 
the 
process 
was 
rather 
slow
EOS
mrs 
singh 
agreed 
to 
tell 
me 
when 
she 
heard 
from 
the 
doctor
EOS
they 
both 
understood 
that 
this 
was 
a 
formality 
and 
that 
he 
was 
not 
thought 
to 
be 
ill
EOS
what 
particularly 
concerned 
me 
was 
their 
feeling 
that 
balbinder 
seemed 
to 
understand 
and 
respond 
better 
in 
punjabi
EOS
mrs 
singh 
expressed 
her 
feelings 
that 
it 
was 
very 
important 
for 
all 
her 
children 
to 
speak 
punjabi 
and 
she 
was 
afraid 
that 
they 
might 
not 
do 
this 
if 
she 
and 
mr 
singh 
spoke 
english
EOS
both 
parents 
were 
very 
concerned 
that 
he 
should 
get 
more 
appropriate 
help

were 
now 
convinced 
that 
this 
would 
be 
provided

had 
received 
a 
letter 
offering 
balbinder 
a 
place

they 
had 
understood 
the 
gist

needed

we 
filled 
in 
the 
acceptance 
form

phoned 
the 
school 
about

balbinder

set 
off

balbinder 
was 
very 
subdued
EOS
his 
mother 
said 
he 
was 
not 
happy 
about 
the 
new 
school

wanted 
to 
stay 
where

he 
did 
not 
speak 
all 
the

mrs

remarked 
what 
a 
long 
way 
it 
seemed
EOS
we 
were 
early 
and 
stood 
in 
the 
playground
EOS
balbinder 
looked 
around 
but 
clung 
to 
mrs 
singh
EOS
we 
went 
in 
and 
were 
ushered 
into 
the 
hall 
where 
a 
number 
of 
other 
new 
children 
were 
looking 
at 
books 
of 
photos 
of 
school 
trips 
and 
events
EOS
we 
were 
asked 
to 
sit 
in 
the 
third 
and 
fourth 
rows

the 
lower 
school 
children 
filed 
in
EOS
the 
head 
explained 
that 
the 
school 
had 
a 
lower/middle/ 
upper 
division 
and 
the 
lower 
school 
head 
briefly 
explained 
that 
the 
children 
were 
going 
to 
show 
the 
parents 
and 
new 
children 
what 
they 
had 
been 
doing
EOS
each 
year 
group 
described 
a 
recent 
trip 
and 
showed 
photos 
and 
work 
they 
had 
done
EOS
the 
classes 
were 
small
as 
was 
the 
number 
of 
ethnic 
minority 
children
EOS
there 
were 
one
or 
possibly 
two
afro-caribbean 
children 
overall 
and 
one 
or 
two 
asian 
children 
in 
each 
group
EOS
mrs 
singh 
and 
balbinder 
noticed 
each 
one 
and 
commented
EOS
it 
was 
hot 
and 
the 
demonstration 
went 
on 
much 
too 
long
but 
it  
gave 
us 
all 
some 
idea 
of 
how 
caring 
the 
teachers 
were 
and 
it 
was 
a 
practical 
illustration 
of 
what 
the 
school 
was 
trying 
to 
do
EOS
the 
children 
were 
then 
asked 
to 
go 
out 
to 
play
EOS
balbinder 
was 
very 
reluctant 
and 
clung 
to 
his 
mother
EOS
he 
had 
lost 
interest 
in 
the 
activities
EOS
there 
had 
been 
too 
much 
talk 
and 
show
early 
on 
and 
he 
had 
been 
wriggling 
about
scraping 
his 
chair 
back 
and 
causing 
mrs 
singh 
to 
reprimand 
him 
constantly
EOS
it 
looked 
as 
if 
we 
would 
have 
to 
take 
him 
out 
but 
an 
older 
asian 
boy 
came 
and 
took 
him 
away
and 
he 
went 
quite 
confidently
EOS
the 
head 
then 
told 
the 
parents 
about 
travel
uniform
swimming 
once 
a 
week 
all 
the 
year 
round
the 
pta
illnesses
notes 
for 
absence 
or 
non-swimming 
and
above 
all
contacting 
the 
school 
whenever 
in 
doubt
EOS
we 
were 
then 
taken 
to 
have 
coffee 
and 
the 
school 
secretary 
handed 
out 
official 
forms 
for 
the 
parents 
to 
fill 
in
EOS
mrs 
singh 
filled 
them 
in 
although 
she 
had 
already 
expressed 
alarm 
at 
the 
number 
of 
notes 
she 
was 
going 
to 
have 
to 
write 
to 
the 
school
EOS
classes 
were 
allocated 
and 
balbinder 
was 
to 
be 
in 
class 
1 
with 
a 
mrs 
allinson 
and 
a 
nursery 
assistant
EOS
it 
was 
small
with 
its 
own 
toilets 
and 
washbasins 
and 
an 
entirely 
private 
playground
EOS
balbinder 
ran 
outside 
straight 
away
gesturing 
to 
me 
to 
come 
and 
look 
at 
it
EOS
in 
the 
playground 
they 
had 
a 
sturdy 
wooden 
house 
with 
door 
and 
windows
climbing 
and 
swinging 
equipment 
and 
lots 
of 
small 
bicycles 
and 
tricycles
EOS
in 
the 
classroom
photos 
of 
the 
trip 
to 
the 
seaside 
were 
on 
display 
and 
there 
were 
small 
circular 
tables
EOS
it 
was 
all 
on 
a 
scale 
much 
more 
appropriate 
for 
children 
than 
the 
high 
vaulting 
of 
his 
previous 
school 
and 
there 
was 
much 
more 
play 
equipment
EOS
this 
filled 
mrs 
singh 
with 
horror
EOS
she 
was 
worried 
by 
the 
way 
he 
roamed 
about 
touching 
everything
and 
during 
a 
long 
chat 
to 
mrs 
allinson 
expressed 
her 
concern 
that 
he 
could 
not 
get 
on 
with 
anything
and 
could 
not 
write 
or 
read
EOS
mrs 
allinson 
was 
very 
reassuring
EOS
however
mrs 
singh 
clearly 
saw 
cedars 
as 
a 
temporary 
phase
EOS
earlier 
on
in 
the 
playground
as 
balbinder 
had 
gradually 
gained 
confidence 
and 
begun 
to 
explore 
and 
use 
things 
mrs 
singh 
had 
said
wistfully
i 
do 
hope 
balbinder 
learn 
so 
quickly 
he 
will 
soon 
go 
back 
to 
his 
school
EOS
on 
the 
way 
out 
the 
head 
knelt 
down 
to 
say 
goodbye 
to 
balbinder
who 
was 
still 
looking 
rather 
mystified 
but 
was 
much 
less 
clinging 
and 
was 
smiling 
more
EOS
in 
the 
car 
on 
the 
way 
home 
he 
sat 
alone
opened 
the 
window 
and 
put 
his 
head 
out
EOS
it 
was 
very 
hard 
to 
imagine 
what 
he 
made 
of 
what 
was 
going 
on
EOS
no 
one 
had 
consulted 
him 
and 
he 
did
n't 
seem 
to 
want 
to 
talk 
about 
it
EOS
in 
all 
these 
transactions 
balbinder 
seemed 
a 
shadowy 
figure
EOS
decisions 
were 
being 
taken 
about 
his 
future 
which 
no 
one 
could 
explain 
to 
him
EOS
over 
the 
last 
few 
months 
he 
had 
become 
rather 
withdrawn 
and 
mistrustful
a 
subdued 
version 
of 
his 
former 
self
EOS
at 
cedars 
mrs 
singh 
had 
instantly 
made 
friends 
with 
a 
young 
asian 
woman 
wearing 
trousers 
and 
a 
shirt
with 
a 
little 
girl 
who 
was 
evidently 
a 
year 
older 
than 
balbinder
EOS
she 
and 
mrs 
singh 
spoke 
in 
punjabi 
but 
her 
english 
sounded 
local 
and 
i 
suspected 
that 
she 
preferred 
to 
speak 
english
EOS
however
mrs 
singh 
was 
pleased 
to 
meet 
her 
and 
generally 
liked 
all 
the 
teachers 
and 
what 
she 
saw
EOS
i 
wondered 
whether 
she 
had 
any 
misgivings
EOS
the 
distance 
will 
certainly 
be 
a  
problem
EOS
what 
she 
was 
making 
of 
this 
experience 
was 
also 
hard 
to 
imagine
EOS
choice 
seemed 
to 
have 
been 
taken 
away 
from 
her
but 
some 
of 
her 
anxieties 
had 
also 
been 
allayed

EOS
in 
september 
balbinder 
started 
at 
cedars
EOS
my 
contact 
with 
the 
family 
became 
much 
less 
frequent
EOS
their 
circumstances 
had 
changed
mr 
singh 
had 
a 
full-time 
job
they 
had 
taken 
a 
big 
step 
and 
purchased 
their 
council 
house

mrs 
singh 
now 
felt 
that 
she 
needed 
permanent 
work 
herself
EOS
the 
job 
she 
finally 
acquired 
during 
the 
summer 
holidays 
meant 
leaving 
home 
before 
the 
children 
and 
returning 
after 
them

the 
coach 
which 
picked 
up 
the 
cedars
' 
children 
stopped 
about 
five 
minutes
' 
walk 
away 
from 
their 
home

balbinder 
had 
to 
be 
seen 
onto 
it

met 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
day
EOS
for 
the 
first 
few 
weeks 
of 
term 
this 
was 
a 
problem
EOS
mr 
singh 
could 
take 
him 
to 
the 
bus 
when 
he 
was 
on 
late 
shifts 
and 
collect 
him 
on 
early 
shifts
EOS
his 
brothers 
aged 
8 
and 
10
whose 
school 
was 
a 
long 
walk 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction
had 
to 
be 
relied 
on 
to 
take 
this 
responsibility 
when 
their 
father 
could 
not
EOS
the 
whole 
operation 
caused 
mrs 
singh 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
anxiety
EOS
by 
half-term
a 
local 
parent 
with 
a 
child 
at 
cedars 
had 
offered 
to 
put 
balbinder 
on 
the 
coach 
in 
the 
morning 
and 
let 
him 
stay 
at 
her 
house 
until 
he 
could 
be 
picked 
up 
in 
the 
evening
EOS
mrs 
singh 
had 
now 
effectively 
become 
cut 
off 
from 
her 
children
's 
education 
just 
as 
balbinder 
had 
been 
cut 
off 
from 
local 
peer 
group 
relationships
EOS
she 
occasionally 
contacted 
me
and 
for 
a 
christmas 
present 
gave 
me 
a 
photograph 
of 
balbinder 
taken 
at 
school

made 
into 
a 
calendar

this 
showed 
him 
sitting 
at

his 
mother

vision

what 
school 
should 
be 
about

she 
and 
mr

had 
visited 
the 
school 
for 
a 
christmas 
event

had 
been 
pleased 
to 
hear 
that 
balbinder 
was 
being 
moved 
into 
the 
second 
class
EOS
she 
had 
been 
worried 
that 
he 
was 
still 
playing 
too 
much 
and 
not 
learning 
anything
EOS
from 
january 
to 
july 
my 
contacts 
with 
the 
family 
were 
infrequent 
and 
concerned 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
two 
older 
boys
EOS
my 
advice 
was 
sought 
on 
several 
occasions 
when 
the 
family 
did 
not 
know 
how 
to 
cope 
with 
quite 
serious 
problems 
concerning 
the 
behaviour 
of 
one 
of 
them
EOS
balbinder 
was 
no 
longer 
a 
worry
EOS
however
in 
july 
mrs 
singh 
phoned 
to 
ask 
whether 
i 
could 
go 
with 
her 
to 
cedars
' 
open 
evening
EOS
she 
wanted 
my 
opinion 
on 
balbinder
's 
progress
EOS
i 
was 
not 
able 
to 
go 
with 
her

as 
i 
was 
in 
contact 
with 
the 
school

section 
xi 
teacher 
at 
the 
time
i 
arranged 
to 
visit

my 
own

the 
section 
xi 
teacher
who 
had 
particular 
responsibility 
for 
balbinder
said 
that 
he 
was 
the 
least 
of 
her 
worries
EOS
he 
had 
been 
moved 
to 
a 
higher 
class
seemed 
well 
adjusted 
and 
chatted 
a 
lot 
when 
she 
worked 
with 
him

his 
class 
teacher 
also 
felt 
that 
he 
was

both 
parents 
had 
come 
to 
the 
open 
evening 
and 
she 
had 
been 
able 
to 
talk 
to 
them
EOS
they 
had 
also 
come 
to 
school 
earlier 
in 
the 
year 
for 
the 
annual 
assessment 
meeting
a 
statutory 
requirement 
for 
children

are

EOS
looking 
back 
to 
her 
first 
encounter 
with 
balbinder 
a 
year 
ago
when 
she 
had 
visited 
him 
at 
his 
previous 
school
she 
said 
that 
she 
had 
been 
shocked
EOS
he 
had 
been 
on 
the 
periphery 
of 
a 
large 
class 
and 
little 
attempt 
was 
being 
made 
to 
involve 
him 
in 
what 
was 
going 
on
EOS
she 
had 
felt 
at 
the 
time 
that 
he 
was 
pretty 
borderline 
for 
special 
school
EOS
it 
seemed 
that 
in 
a 
school 
where 
he 
was 
in 
such 
a 
minority
his 
language 
and 
ethnicity 
had 
been 
defined 
as 
particular 
problems 
requiring 
the 
rather 
draconian 
solution 
of 
statementing
EOS
his 
present 
class 
teacher 
and 
the 
section 
xi 
teacher 
both 
agreed 
that 
he 
was 
a 
slow 
learner
but 
felt 
that 
he 
did 
not 
exhibit 
the 
behavioural 
problems 
nor 
degrees 
of 
learning 
difficulty 
that 
characterised 
many 
of 
the 
children 
in 
the 
school
EOS
this 
was 
borne 
out 
by 
observing 
him 
in 
the 
classroom
where 
he 
was 
sitting 
quietly 
working
in 
contrast 
with 
the 
much 
less 
controlled 
behaviour 
of 
other 
children 
in 
this 
small 
group
EOS
in 
this 
environment 
he 
appeared 
to 
have 
become 
a 
model 
pupil
EOS
however
despite 
the 
small 
class 
and 
the 
specialist 
attention 
he 
was 
still 
considered 
far 
behind 
for 
a 
7 
year 
old
EOS
he 
could 
not 
read 
or 
write 
independently
EOS
his 
written 
work
like 
both 
his 
brothers
'
was 
neat 
and 
controlled
consisting 
of 
short 
accounts 
of 
daily 
events 
which 
the 
teacher 
had 
transcribed 
and 
he 
had 
carefully 
illustrated 
and 
copied
EOS
the 
question 
of 
return 
to 
mainstream 
schooling 
was 
not 
being 
considered
EOS
later
talking 
to 
his 
teacher 
after 
a 
year 
and 
two 
terms 
at 
cedars
it 
seemed 
that 
balbinder
's 
conversational 
language 
was 
developing 
well
he 
could 
hold 
his 
own 
in 
a 
small 
group 
often 
initiating 
topics 
of 
interest
describing
explaining 
and 
enquiring
EOS
however
his 
teacher 
warned 
that 
proficiency 
in 
conversational 
language 
should 
not 
be 
assumed 
to 
equate 
with 
proficiency 
in 
cognitive 
or 
academic
language
EOS
she 
reported 
on 
his 
good 
imagination
something 
which 
shows 
up 
particularly 
in 
his 
drawings 
which 
always 
contain 
fine 
detail
EOS
out 
of 
mainstream 
education 
perhaps 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
his 
school 
career
balbinder 
is 
no 
longer 
defined 
as 
a 
problem
EOS
his 
re-entry
however
either 
to 
mainstream 
or 
to 
the 
start 
of 
adult 
working 
life
may 
not 
be 
achieved 
so 
smoothly
EOS
the 
process 
of 
statementing 
has 
disrupted 
his 
normal 
development
EOS
it 
has 
not 
taken 
into 
account 
the 
evident 
disjuncture 
between 
the 
cultural 
norms 
of 
his 
home 
and 
community 
and 
those 
of 
the 
school
EOS
in 
a 
more 
recent 
conversation 
with 
his 
mother 
she 
was 
still 
worried 
about 
him 
despite 
good 
reports 
from 
the 
school 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
now 
speaks 
both 
languages 
all 
right
EOS
her 
lack 
of 
contact 
with 
the 
school
the 
distance 
and 
her 
work 
made 
her 
feel 
helpless

balbinder

at

saw

this 
chapter 
looks 
at 
the 
perceptions 
of 
parents 
of 
their 
role 
in 
the 
assessment 
of 
their 
child
's 
special 
educational 
needs 
as 
part 
of 
the 
statementing 
process 
carried 
out 
under 
the 
1981 
education 
act
EOS
the 
analysis 
is 
based 
on 
observations 
of 
professional 
parent 
and 
professional 
child 
interactions 
during 
the 
assessments 
of 
thirty 
children 
referred 
to 
the 
schools 
psychological 
service 
in 
three 
leas 
because 
they 
were 
thought 
to 
have 
emotional 
and 
behavioural 
difficulties
EOS
in 
each 
case 
these 
observations 
were 
complemented 
by 
interviews 
held 
with 
the 
participants
EOS
introduction
perceptions 
differ
EOS
perhaps 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that
without 
exception
the 
professionals 
to 
whom 
we 
talked 
stated 
emphatically 
that 
their 
overriding 
concern 
was 
to 
act 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
their 
child 
clients
EOS
likewise
they 
expressed 
a 
desire 
to 
involve 
parents 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
decision-making
EOS
the 
former 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
ethical 
codes 
of 
their 
professional 
associations

established 
in

the 
1981

does 
the 
1981 
act 
assist 
or 
inhibit 
cooperation 
between 
professionals 
and 
parents
EOS
on 
face 
value 
the 
act 
formalises 
a 
cooperative 
framework
EOS
in 
practice
however
the 
bureaucratisation 
of 
the 
professional 
parent 
relationship 
and 
the 
assessment 
process 
may 
lead 
to 
a 
situation 
in 
which 
the 
primary 
function 
of 
parental 
involvement 
is 
to 
legitimise 
professional 
decisions
EOS
many 
parents 
felt 
that 
their 
own 
contribution 
to 
the 
assessment 
was 
only 
taken 
seriously 
when 
it 
supported 
what 
the 
professionals 
were 
saying
EOS
on 
many 
occasions 
in 
our 
study 
we 
found 
a 
sharp 
contrast 
between 
the 
professionals
' 
perception 
that 
a 
high 
degree 
of 
consensus 
had 
been 
reached 
and 
the 
parents
' 
perception 
that 
they 
had 
agreed 
to 
a 
course 
of 
action 
because 
they 
saw 
no 
other 
real 
choice
particularly 
if 
the 
urgent 
needs 
of 
the 
child 
and 
other 
family 
members 
were 
to 
be 
quickly 
met
EOS
in 
the 
following 
section 
we 
use 
case 
history 
data 
to 
identify 
ways 
in 
which 
the 
professional 
parent 
relationship 
operates 
within 
the 
context 
of 
the 
1981 
act
EOS
this 
is 
followed 
by 
a 
discussion 
of 
the 
impact 
the 
1981 
act 
has 
had 
on 
the 
notion 
of 
partnership
EOS

studies
EOS
each 
of 
the 
examples 
in 
this 
section

the 
complexities 
which 
lie 
behind 
the 
definition 
of 
problem 
and

EOS
cooperation 
with

may 
be 
made 
particularly 
difficult 
where 
the 
professional 
identifies 
a 
conflict 
of 
interests 
between 
parents 
and 
child
EOS
for 
example
the

because 
they 
are 
viewed 
in 
this 
light 
parents 
may 
respond 
with 
diffidence 
to 
those 
carrying 
out 
the 
assessment 
of 
their 
child 
and 
simply 
reflect 
back 
and 
reinforce 
professional 
perceptions
EOS
in 
john
's 
case 
the 
stated 
reason 
for 
referral 
for 
formal 
assessment 
was 
his 
behaviour 
in 
school
EOS
however
underlying 
this 
was 
his 
teachers
' 
deeper 
concern 
that 
he 
might 
be 
a 
victim 
of 
physical 
and 
sexual 
abuse
EOS
the 
evidence 
in 
support 
of 
these 
allegations 
was 
vague 
and 
in 
the 
event 
unsubstantiated 
despite 
in 
extensive 
social 
services 
investigation 
which 
ran 
parallel 
to 
the 
statementing 
procedures
EOS
in 
drawing 
her 
conclusions 
about 
the 
family 
situation 
the 
head 
teacher 
pointed 
to 
the 
fact
that 
john
's 
parents 
were 
only 
cooperative 
on 
the 
surface
EOS
mum 
was 
initially 
cooperative
and 
mr 
peel 
was 
likewise 
quite 
cooperative
until 
the 
decision 
was 
made 
to 
statement
after 
that 
he 
opted 
out 
and 
did
n't 
contact 
me
EOS
mrs 
peel
however
saw 
things 
differently
saying 
of 
the 
head
she 
seemed 
to 
be 
assessing 
me 
rather 
than 
john
it
's 
like 
she
's 
shifting 
the 
blame 
on 
to 
me
she 
used 
to 
speak 
to 
me 
like 
i 
was 
a 
really 
bad 
mother
EOS
i 
used 
to 
come 
home 
in 
tears
EOS
the 
school 
found 
some 
support 
for 
their 
interpretation 
of 
mrs 
peel
's 
behaviour 
from 
a 
community 
nurse 
who 
tried 
to 
work 
with 
the 
family
she 
thinks 
there
's 
evidence 
of 
sexual 
abuse
soiling
language 
and 
sexually 
overt 
behaviour
EOS
in 
addition 
the 
nurse
too
thought 
that 
the 
parents 
were 
uncooperative 
and 
that 
they 
were 
hiding 
something
EOS
she 
stated 
in 
her 
report
on 
the 
occasions 
of 
visiting 
home 
i 
have 
felt 
most 
unwelcome 
and 
am 
therefore 
limited 
in 
the 
intervention 
i 
can 
provide
EOS
she 
recommended 
that 
a 
meeting 
with 
social 
services 
would 
be 
helpful 
to 
alert 
them 
to 
the 
dynamics
of 
this 
family 
and 
to 
advise 
them 
that 
as 
professionals 
we 
were 
anxious 
that 
we 
had 
not 
managed 
to 
engage 
and 
intervene 
within 
the 
family 
and 
explore 
deficits 
in 
the 
parenting 
role
EOS
following 
the 
nurse
's 
report 
a 
meeting 
was 
held 
with 
social 
services
EOS
according 
to 
mrs 
peel 
who 
was 
invited 
to 
attend
EOS
all 
different 
people 
went 
in 
the 
meeting

could
n't 
go

when 
i 
was 
allowed 
in 
the 
child 
abuse 
officer 
was 
in 
the 
chair 
and 
he 
told 
me 
that 
his 
behaviour 
was 
the 
behaviour 
of 
a 
child 
who 
was 
being 
sexually 
abused
EOS
they 
said 
they 
were 
not 
saying 
it 
was
but 
it 
was 
the 
behaviour
EOS
i 
went 
home 
in 
tears
EOS
they 
asked 
me 
to 
take 
the 
children 
for 
a 
full 
medical
EOS
i 
did
n't 
want 
to 
but 
i 
was 
frightened 
they 
would 
think 
it 
was 
true
so 
i 
let 
them 
do 
it
EOS
i 
felt 
because 
they 
could
n't 
come 
up 
with 
anything 
else 
they 
brought 
this 
up 
to 
show 
it 
was 
something 
it 
home
it
's 
all 
been 
dropped 
now 
i 
think
EOS
from 
the 
perspectives 
of 
both 
professionals 
and 
parents 
the 
attempt 
to 
build 
a 
cooperative 
framework 
directed 
towards 
meeting 
john
's 
needs 
had 
broken 
down
EOS
according 
to 
the 
professionals 
the 
breakdown 
happened 
because 
the 
parents 
were 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
child
's 
special 
needs
EOS
consequently
cooperation 
was 
defined 
by 
the 
professionals 
in 
terms 
that 
allowed 
them
in 
the 
words 
of 
the 
community 
nurse
to 
intervene 
within 
the 
family 
and 
explore 
deficits 
in 
the 
parenting 
role
EOS
the 
parents 
were 
expected 
to 
accept 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
professionals 
even 
though 
there 
is 
little 
evidence 
to 
support 
their 
judgement
EOS
the 
parents
' 
sense 
of 
disempowerment 
was 
at 
this 
stage 
complete
EOS
cooperation 
with 
the 
professionals 
required 
acceptance 
of 
the 
framework 
within 
which 
john
's 
needs 
had 
been 
professionally 
cast
that 
it 
was 
their 
deficits 
as 
parents 
which 
had 
created 
john
's 
needs
EOS
on 
the 
other 
hand
refusal 
to 
cooperate 
would 
have 
been 
perceived 
by 
the 
professionals 
as 
reinforcing 
the 
latter
's 
initial 
perceptions
EOS
the 
definition 
of 
a 
problem
its 
source 
and 
the 
needs
that 
arise 
from 
it 
are 
frequently 
established 
by 
professionals 
at 
an 
early 
stage 
and 
as 
we 
see 
here 
the 
parents
because 
they 
lack 
information 
and 
power
may 
find 
it 
very 
difficult 
to 
challenge 
such 
assumptions
EOS
john
's 
case 
also 
suggests 
how 
the 
perceptions 
of 
those 
professionals 
involved 
at 
an 
early 
stage 
of 
an 
assessment 
and 
the 
actions 
that 
follow 
may 
influence
direct 
or 
constrain 
the 
later 
perceptions 
and 
actions 
of 
other 
professionals
EOS
the 
educational 
psychologist 
ep
expressed 
surprise 
that 
on 
every 
occasion 
he 
had 
met 
john 
the 
latter 
had 
always 
been 
attentive 
and 
cooperative 
but 
felt 
that 
we 
have 
to 
accept 
what 
we 
are 
told 
about 
his 
behaviour 
by 
his 
teachers
EOS
for 
this 
reason 
when 
the 
head 
teacher 
eventually 
excluded 
john 
permanently 
from 
school 
because 
of 
his 
behaviour 
the 
ep 
accepted 
that 
the 
school 
were 
acting 
reasonably 
in 
the 
circumstances 
and 
that 
they 
had 
made 
every 
effort 
with 
john
EOS
the 
ep 
observed 
that 
john
's 
language 
is 
so 
adult 
and 
behaviour 
so 
violent 
to 
other 
people 
that 
the 
school 
could 
not 
put 
up 
with 
it 
any 
longer
EOS
on 
the 
other 
hand
the 
psychologist 
also 
recognised 
how 
the 
scope 
for 
his 
own 
intervention 
was 
restricted 
by 
the 
school
's 
actions
EOS
the 
exclusion 
shuts 
doors 
in 
terms 
of 
possible 
recommendation
EOS
likewise
the 
ep
after 
visiting 
the 
family 
on 
a 
number 
of 
occasions
said 
that 
the 
community 
nurse
's 
impressions 
do
n't 
ring 
true 
with 
my  
own 
experience
EOS
he 
also 
felt 
that 
the 
evidence 
of 
abuse 
was 
unconvincing 
but 
given 
the 
involvement 
of 
other 
agencies 
in 
this 
area 
it 
was 
beyond 
his 
remit 
to 
challenge 
it 
in 
compiling 
his 
advice 
for 
the 
statement
EOS
mrs 
peel 
thought 
the 
ep 
to 
be 
more 
sympathetic 
than 
the 
other 
professionals 
she 
had 
encountered 
and 
that 
made 
it 
easier 
for 
her 
to 
convey 
her 
views 
to 
him
EOS
none 
the 
less 
her 
experiences 
with 
those 
other 
professionals 
led 
her 
to 
believe 
that 
she 
could 
nut 
affect 
the 
result 
of 
their 
deliberations
EOS
she 
felt 
she 
had

in

by 
looking 
at

we 
examine 
the 
interactive 
process

relationships 
underlying 
the 
development 
of 
an 
apparent 
consensus
EOS
we 
show 
how 
this 
consensus 
was 
identified 
as 
strong 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
a 
professional
yet 
fragile 
and 
disempowering 
from 
the 
perspective 
of

george 
is 
a 
9 
year 
old 
attending 
a 
primary 
school 
in 
a 
working-class 
part

according 
to 
the

teacher 
it 
may 
look 
very 
nice 
but 
we 
have 
a 
lot 
of 
difficult 
families 
and 
children
EOS
george 
comes 
from 
a 
large 
family 
and 
the 
home 
situation 
is 
acknowledged 
by 
his 
parents 
to 
be 
stressful 
because 
of 
overcrowding 
and 
financial 
difficulties
EOS
one 
of 
george
's 
brothers 
was 
recently 
placed 
in 
a 
residential 
school 
for 
children 
with 
moderate 
learning 
difficulties 
as 
a 
weekly 
boarder
EOS
the 
family 
have 
experienced 
a 
lot 
of 
conflict 
with 
george
's 
school 
and 
since 
moving 
home 
some 
twelve 
months 
ago 
have 
made 
efforts
unsuccessfully
to 
transfer 
their 
children 
to 
a 
different 
primary 
school
EOS
george 
was 
referred 
to 
the 
lea 
for 
formal 
assessment 
under 
the 
act 
on 
the 
grounds 
of 
emotional 
and 
behavioural 
difficulties 
as 
an 
urgent 
case
EOS
his 
teachers 
reported 
that 
the 
problem 
was 
behaviour 
in 
class 
and 
at 
home
EOS
in 
school
george 
was 
described 
as 
aggressive
he 
wanders 
about 
instead 
of 
getting 
on 
with 
his 
work
he 
wo
n't 
conform
he
's 
like 
his 
brother
generally 
he 
disturbs 
other 
children
EOS
he 
disturbs 
their 
work
EOS
those 
behaviours 
were 
identified 
by 
his 
teachers 
as 
arising 
directly 
from 
the 
problems 
george 
faced 
in 
the 
home
EOS
at 
the 
outset 
the 
willingness 
of 
george
's 
parents 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
school 
staff 
in 
discussing 
the 
home 
situation 
and 
how 
this 
might 
affect 
george
's 
behaviour 
in 
school 
was 
used 
by 
the 
teaching 
staff 
as 
evidence 
in 
support 
of 
their 
case 
that 
george
's 
needs 
could 
not 
be 
met 
within 
a 
mainstream 
school
EOS
as 
the 
assessment 
progressed 
those 
two 
factors 
were 
at 
the 
forefront 
of 
the 
school

case

educational 
psychologist

EOS
we 
can 
see 
here 
how
at 
an 
early 
stage
the 
discourse 
of 
needs 
was 
established
EOS
the 
main 
feature 
of 
this 
discourse 
was 
that 
george
's 
needs 
were 
conceptualised 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
teachers
' 
perceptions 
of 
their 
own 
needs
in 
particular 
the 
threat 
george 
was 
seen 
as 
presenting 
to 
order 
and 
discipline 
within 
the 
school
EOS
the 
ep
's 
role 
was 
seen 
by 
the 
teaching 
staff 
as 
being 
to 
advise 
the 
school
EOS
the 
ep 
was 
brought 
in
in 
response 
to 
the 
teachers
' 
perception 
that 
they 
lacked 
the 
skills 
to 
manage 
george
's 
behaviour
EOS
however
despite 
the 
way 
teachers 
represented 
their 
views 
mr 
and 
mrs 
shod 
doubted 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
problem
i 
do
n't 
think 
he
's 
any 
worse 
than 
other 
kids 
he
's 
picked 
on 
by 
the 
school
EOS
their 
stated 
wish 
was 
for 
him 
to 
be 
moved 
to 
another 
mainstream 
school
EOS
as 
regards 
the 
home 
situation 
their 
perspective 
was 
subtly 
and 
significantly 
different 
from 
that 
of 
the 
school
EOS
they 
acknowledged 
the 
stressfulness 
of 
the 
family 
situation 
but 
wanted 
help 
toward 
removing 
the 
stresses 
rather 
than 
to 
have 
george 
removed 
from 
the 
home
EOS
it 
is 
important 
to 
recognise 
their 
willingness 
to 
consider 
residential 
school 
in 
this 
context
EOS
when 
it 
was 
suggested 
to 
them 
as 
a 
possibility 
it 
was 
understood 
by 
them 
as 
an 
opportunity 
for 
a 
breathing 
space 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
other 
alternative 
EOS
it 
was 
a 
misperception 
of 
the 
parental 
perspective 
that 
was 
used 
by 
the 
professionals 
to 
legitimise 
the 
latter
's 
recommendations
EOS
this 
is 
illustrated 
in 
the 
following 
exchange
EOS
mr 
short 
there 
used 
to 
be 
a 
place 
in 
scotland 
where 
kids 
could 
go 
to 
give 
parents 
a 
break
EOS
i 
do
n't 
know 
if 
there
's 
anything 
like 
that 
round 
here
EOS
you
've 
got 
to 
think 
of 
the 
kids 
as 
well
EOS
they
've 
never 
had 
any 
holiday
EOS
ep 
i
'll 
try 
to 
make 
some 
enquiries 
about 
holidays
EOS
i 
do 
feel 
that 
george 
will 
need 
some 
special 
schooling 
he
's 
not 
getting 
what 
he 
needs
EOS
not 
because 
of 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
the 
school 
but 
he 
needs 
special 
help 
i 
think 
we 
should 
think 
about 
your 
feelings
EOS
let's 
try 
and 
get 
some 
help 
for 
you 
and 
the 
family
EOS
thus 
the 
ep 
links 
parental 
desire 
for 
respite 
from 
family 
stress 
with 
the 
notion 
of 
special 
schooling
EOS
once 
this 
link 
is 
established 
mrs 
shott 
is 
asked 
to 
consider 
a 
residential 
placement 
and 
the 
parents
' 
own 
anxieties 
about 
their 
family 
situation 
and 
needs 
are 
used 
to 
justify 
the 
proposal 
being 
put 
forward
EOS
the 
different 
perspectives 
of 
ep 
and 
parents 
were 
reflected 
in 
the 
confusion 
over 
what 
had 
been 
decided 
at 
that 
meeting
EOS
the 
ep 
wrote 
in 
a 
memorandum 
to

i 
feel 
that 
george

benefit 
from

residential 
school

emotional 
and 
behavioural 
problems

mr

weekly

when 
questioned 
by 
a

mr

mrs

restated 
their 
preference 
for

placement

also

opposition

john 
says 
you

do
n't

EOS
yet 
mrs

despite 
her 
strongly 
held 
views
expressed 
resignation 
in 
playing 
little 
part 
in 
the 
decision-making 
process
a 
resignation 
based 
in 
part 
upon 
experience
EOS
we 
did
n't 
bet 
much 
to 
do 
with 
john
's 
assessment
EOS
i 
did
n't 
want 
him 
to 
go 
to 
residential 
school 
at 
all
EOS
the 
professionals 
were 
seen 
by 
mrs 
short 
as 
decision-makers 
and 
therefore 
when 
asked 
about 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
meeting 
with 
the 
ep 
she 
was 
unclear 
because 
i 
have
n't 
been 
told
EOS
the 
parents 
believed
however
that 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
assessment 
would 
be 
a 
placement 
in 
a 
special 
school 
whatever 
their 
own 
views

in 
a 
later 
meeting

former
in 
response 
to 
the 
psychologist

efforts 
to 
identify/impose

consensus

articulate 
their 
own 
understanding 
of

needs

ep 
last

saw

be 
looking 
at 
some 
kind 
of 
school 
with 
weekly 
boarding

mrs 
short 
said 
she 
would 
prefer 
george 
to 
attend 
a 
mainstream 
school

that
's 
where 
you 
would 
like 
him 
to 
go
EOS
mr 
and 
mrs 
short 
yes
EOS
ep 
one 
possible 
school 
would 
be 
weekly 
boarding 
if 
you 
visited 
there 
would 
be 
no 
guarantee
EOS
mr 
short 
to 
be 
honest 
with 
you 
we 
have 
one 
child 
already 
at 
one 
of 
those 
schools 
and 
when 
he 
comes 
home 
he
's 
a 
lot 
worse
EOS
the 
psychologist 
in 
a 
separate 
interview 
with 
the 
researcher 
expressed 
the 
belief 
that 
this 
fact
was 
evidence 
of 
the 
unsuitability 
of 
the 
home 
situation
EOS
this 
contrasted 
sharply 
with 
the 
parents
' 
belief 
that 
the 
child
's 
poor 
behaviour 
at 
home 
was 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
latter 
perceiving 
himself 
to 
have 
been 
rejected 
by 
the 
family 
because 
he 
had 
been 
sent 
to 
a 
boarding 
school
EOS
the 
psychologist 
suggested 
that 
the 
parents 
themselves 
really 
wanted 
george 
to 
be 
placed 
in 
a 
residential 
school 
but 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
appear 
that 
they 
were 
rejecting 
him
EOS
they 
see 
residential 
school 
as 
an 
alternative 
to 
care
but 
it 
has 
less 
stigma 
for 
them
EOS
i 
think 
that
's 
what 
they
've 
really 
wanted 
all 
the 
way 
along
EOS
the 
psychologist 
justified 
his 
own 
persuasive 
efforts 
with 
this 
belief 
that 
he 
was 
actually 
helping 
the 
parents 
to 
come 
to 
terms 
with 
a 
decision 
they 
really 
want 
to 
make 
EOS
ep 
what 
i 
suggest 
we 
do 
nothing
's 
going 
to 
be 
decided 
today 
i 
can 
arrange 
for 
you 
to 
have 
a 
look 
at 
one 
of 
these 
weekly 
residential 
schools 
at 
this 
stage 
we
're 
saying 
let's 
look
EOS
mr 
and 
mrs 
short 
that
's 
ok
EOS
the 
validity 
of 
the 
psychologist
's 
interpretation 
of 
parental 
motives 
in 
this 
case 
is  
difficult 
to 
assess
EOS
in 
the 
end 
it 
depends 
upon 
professional 
judgement
EOS
whether 
or 
not 
it 
is 
correct
it 
quite 
clearly 
differs 
from 
the 
parents
' 
explicit 
account 
of 
their 
perception 
of 
how 
the 
decision 
has 
been 
reached

the 
implications 
it 
will 
have 
for 
george

mr

far 
as 
i
'm 
concerned

give 
up 
too 
soon

the

were 
talking 
at

our 
third 
example 
focuses 
upon 
conflicting 
perceptions

the 
purpose 
of 
assessment 
under 
the 
1981 
act 
and 
the 
relationship 
between 
information 
and 
control
EOS
it 
raises 
questions 
about 
how 
the 
act 
itself 
can 
become 
a 
controlling 
force 
to 
limit 
parental 
action
EOS
twelve 
months 
ago 
tom 
had 
been 
placed 
two 
half-days 
each 
week 
in 
an 
off-site 
unit 
for 
disruptive 
children
EOS
this 
placement 
followed 
the 
breakup 
of 
his 
parents
' 
marriage 
which 
was 
acknowledged 
by 
his 
mother
but 
not 
his 
father
as 
having 
a 
serious 
effect 
upon 
tom
's 
behaviour
EOS
after 
the 
breakup 
the 
parents 
were 
awarded 
joint 
custody 
and 
tom 
resided 
for 
part 
of 
the 
week 
with 
each
EOS
mrs 
jones 
felt 
that 
this 
arrangement 
was 
itself 
disruptive 
and 
should 
be 
changed
EOS
mr 
jones 
did 
not 
agree
EOS
he 
felt 
that 
tom 
caused 
him 
no 
problems 
and 
it 
was 
tom
's 
relationship 
with 
his 
mother 
that 
was 
at 
the 
root 
of 
the 
difficulties 
he 
had
EOS
tom 
had 
recently 
been 
referred 
by 
his 
mainstream 
school 
to 
the 
psychological 
service 
for 
assessment 
under 
the 
1981 
act 
because 
teachers 
felt 
they 
should 
receive 
additional 
support 
for 
tom
's 
periods 
in 
mainstream 
school
EOS
the 
ep 
in 
this 
case 
felt 
that 
even 
more 
drastic 
measures 
might 
be 
required
EOS
in 
his 
view 
tom 
was 
being 
used 
as 
a 
pawn 
in 
the 
relationship 
between 
his 
parents 
and 
unless 
his 
parents 
did 
come 
to 
an 
arrangement 
whereby 
a 
more 
stable 
home 
situation
was 
provided
tom 
would 
benefit 
from 
a 
residential 
school 
placement
EOS
tom
's 
mother 
was 
highly 
critical 
of 
the 
way 
the 
mainstream 
school 
was 
handling 
him 
but 
agreed 
to 
the 
assessment 
because 
she 
felt 
it 
might 
help 
him
EOS
initially 
she 
welcomed 
the 
professionals
' 
involvement 
because 
she 
believed 
this 
might 
result 
in 
help 
and 
advice 
in 
identifying 
the 
reasons 
for 
tom
's 
deteriorating 
behaviour
EOS
once 
the 
assessment 
had 
begun 
mrs 
jones 
soon 
became 
disillusioned
EOS
she 
complained 
bitterly 
about 
the 
lack 
of 
information 
she 
was 
receiving
EOS
perhaps 
this 
reflected 
a 
lack 
of 
clarity 
about 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
assessment 
and 
the 
conflicting 
expectations 
participants 
held 
of 
its 
outcome
EOS
mrs 
jones 
expected 
feedback 
and 
dialogue 
about 
the 
development 
of 
an 
intervention 
strategy
EOS
when 
she 
later 
challenged 
the 
ep 
she 
was 
told 
she 
should 
have 
contacted

she 
could
n't 
recollect

been 
informed

EOS
in 
any 
case 
she 
had 
not 
expected 
that 
her 
role 
in 
the

would 
be 
limited 
to 
receiving 
information 
back 
from 
an  
ewo

did

ask

mrs 
jones 
felt 
that 
the 
slow 
progress

the 
assessment 
and 
the 
limited 
information 
she 
received 
created 
new

mrs

faced
EOS
a 
lack 
of 
common 
agreement 
over 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
assessment 
was 
something 
mrs 
jones 
had 
not 
anticipated
EOS
whereas 
she 
had 
seen 
the 
assessment 
as 
a 
way 
of 
addressing 
tom
's 
unsettled 
home 
situation
establishing 
an 
objective 
base 
line 
from 
which 
she 
and 
her 
ex-husband 
could 
identify 
how 
their 
differences 
were 
affecting 
tom
the

become 
involved 
in 
this 
area
EOS
it
's 
difficult 
if 
i
'm 
to 
remain 
neutral
EOS
yet 
the 
ep 
was 
willing 
to 
use 
this 
dispute 
as 
a 
justification 
for 
his 
recommendation 
for 
residential 
schooling
EOS
in 
addition
mrs 
jones 
was 
dissatisfied 
that 
little 
attention 
appeared 
to 
have 
been 
given 
to 
tom
's 
problems 
in 
school
EOS
she 
had 
been 
told 
on 
one 
occasion 
by 
the 
ep 
that 
tom
's 
behaviour 
problems 
might 
have 
been 
the 
result 
of 
frustration 
over 
reading 
difficulties
EOS
she 
had 
found 
this 
information 
to 
be 
very 
positive 
because 
they 
can 
focus 
on 
dealing 
with 
it 
now
it 
spells 
out 
a 
lot 
of 
hope
EOS
yet 
she 
felt 
little 
had 
been 
done 
to 
address 
this 
problem 
in 
school 
and 
if 
in 
these 
circumstances 
she 
now 
accepted 
residential 
school 
she 
would 
be 
giving 
up 
on 
tom
EOS
none 
the 
less 
the 
ep 
continued 
to 
recommend 
residential 
schooling
EOS
mrs 
jones
's 
response 
was 
no 
way 
am 
i 
going 
to 
agree 
with 
that
EOS
on 
the 
other 
hand
on 
a 
different 
occasion 
she 
expressed 
feelings 
of 
depression 
and 
powerlessness 
in 
the 
face 
of 
professional 
opinion
conceding 
that 
she 
might 
allow 
him 
to 
go 
to 
residential 
school 
if 
it 
could 
be 
shown 
that 
it 
was 
in 
his 
best 
interests
EOS
once 
the 
ep 
had 
recommended 
residential 
schooling 
in 
his 
report 
mrs 
jones 
expressed 
little 
confidence 
in 
her 
rights
under 
the 
law
EOS
but 
she 
remained 
determined 
to 
play 
an 
equal 
part 
in 
defining 
the 
nature 
of 
her 
child
's 
needs
EOS
she 
had 
seen 
the 
initial 
stage 
of 
the 
assessment 
process 
as 
an 
opportunity 
to 
enhance 
her 
role 
in 
the 
decision-making 
but 
saw 
it 
as 
restricting 
her 
power
EOS
she 
therefore 
decided 
to 
abandon 
reliance 
on 
official 
procedures
EOS
she 
moved 
house 
and 
with 
the 
cooperation 
of 
the 
new 
local 
head 
teacher 
changed 
tom
's 
mainstream 
school
and 
withdrew 
him 
from 
the 
off-site 
unit
EOS
the 
ep 
and 
lea 
were 
now 
presented 
with 
a 
fait 
accompli 
EOS
according 
to 
mrs 
jones 
they 
had 
little 
option 
in 
the 
circumstances 
but 
to 
allow 
her 
decision 
a 
chance 
to 
fail

discussion
disempowerment 
by

EOS
the 
1981 
education 
act 
clearly 
states 
the 
procedures 
that 
must 
be 
followed 
to 
maximise 
parental 
involvement 
in 
the 
decision-making 
process
EOS
it 
identifies 
the 
range 
of 
information 
that 
must 
be 
made 
available 
to 
parents 
and 
the 
right 
of  
parents 
to 
contribute 
their 
own 
advice 
and 
evidence 
to 
the 
assessment
EOS
moreover
procedures 
are 
established 
for 
parents 
to 
seek 
clarification
state 
objections 
and 
appeal 
against 
recommendations
EOS
a 
strong 
case 
can 
be 
put 
forward 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
no 
decision 
can 
be 
taken 
without 
full 
consultation 
with 
parents 
and 
due 
deference 
to 
their 
views
EOS
in 
practice 
there 
is 
increasing 
evidence 
that 
the 
rights 
of 
parents 
under 
the 
act 
are 
not 
always 
given 
prominence
EOS
a 
number 
of 
commentators 
have 
suggested 
that 
once 
the 
assessment 
procedures 
have 
been 
initiated 
parents 
become 
increasingly 
marginalised 
in 
the 
process
EOS
dyson 
1986
for 
example
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
professionals
' 
confidential 
files 
often 
contain 
materials 
contributing 
to 
the 
social 
stereotyping 
of 
children 
and 
their 
families
EOS
this 
information 
might 
be 
circulated 
informally 
amongst 
professionals 
but 
parents 
remain 
ignorant 
of 
its 
existence
EOS
chaudhury 
1986
and 
rehal 
1989
identified 
how 
parents 
of 
ethnic 
minority 
children 
may 
be 
disadvantaged 
during 
special 
needs 
assessments 
by 
the 
failure 
of 
leas 
and 
professionals 
to 
take 
account 
of 
language 
and 
cultural 
factors
EOS
goacher

EOS
1988
found 
marked 
differences 
between 
leas 
in 
the 
role 
parents 
are 
allowed 
to 
play
EOS
it 
seems 
certain 
that 
even 
the 
small 
change 
in 
the 
balance 
of 
power 
between 
professionals 
and 
parents 
brought 
about

in 
a 
number 
of 
authorities

EOS
it 
might 
be 
suggested 
that 
the 
disempowerment 
of 
parents 
arises 
from 
a 
combination 
of 
leas 
seeking 
to 
maintain 
control 
over 
the 
distribution 
of 
resources 
and 
professionals 
seeking 
to 
secure 
the 
autonomy 
of 
their 
professional 
role
EOS
yet 
we 
can 
find 
evidence 
of 
leas 
taking 
their 
responsibilities 
under 
the 
act 
for 
involving 
parents 
very 
seriously
presenting 
information 
and 
reports 
in 
ways 
designed 
to 
make 
the 
assessment 
meaningful 
and 
accessible 
to 
parents
EOS
none 
the 
less
even 
in 
these 
cases 
parents 
may 
find 
the 
concepts 
of 
disclosure
and 
involvement
to 
operate 
implicitly 
as 
disempowering 
forces
EOS
mittler 
and 
mittler 
1982
make 
a 
similar 
point 
when 
they 
argue 
that 
a 
clear 
distinction 
should 
be 
drawn 
between 
the 
concepts 
of 
partnership
and 
involvement
EOS
whilst 
the 
former 
emphasises 
the 
sharing 
of 
power 
as 
well 
as 
expertise
the 
latter 
contains 
an 
implicit 
assumption 
of 
professional 
expertise 
and 
control
EOS
swann 
1987
has 
argued 
that 
as 
long 
as 
segregated 
provision 
exists
a 
means 
to 
select 
and 
allocate 
children 
will 
be 
needed
EOS
this
he 
suggests
is 
the 
main 
purpose 
of 
statementing
EOS
because 
statementing 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
allocation 
of 
resources 
rather 
than 
with 
the 
identification 
of 
needs 
strict 
limits 
are 
placed 
on 
the 
power 
of 
parents 
to 
affect 
the 
statementing 
process
EOS
if 
swann 
is 
correct 
the 
identification 
of 
needs 
will 
be 
resource-led
EOS
the 
1981 
act 
itself 
may 
be 
read 
as 
implicitly 
setting 
out 
this 
principle
and 
galloway 
and 
goodwin 
1987
have 
demonstrated 
its 
operation 
in 
practice
EOS
as 
swann 
1987
argues
without 
the 
power 
to 
make 
decisions 
about 
resources
parent 
involvement 
within 
the 
1981 
act 
is 
concerned 
with 
recruiting 
parents 
as 
resources 
in 
the 
education 
of 
their 
children
pursuing 
goals 
defined 
by

EOS
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
concept 
of 
need
is 
defined 
by 
the 
1981 
act 
may 
also  
serve 
to 
reinforce 
the 
limits 
on 
parental 
power
EOS
the 
act 
abolished 
the 
ten 
categories 
of 
handicap 
identified 
under 
the 
1945 
handicapped 
pupils 
and 
school 
health 
regulations 
des 
1945
and 
replaced 
them 
with 
the 
concept 
of 
special 
educational 
need
EOS
need
was 
redefined 
in 
terms 
of 
learning 
difficulties 
significantly 
greater 
than 
those 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
children
EOS
this 
shifted 
the 
conceptual 
focus 
away 
from 
needs 
as 
defined 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
child
's 
handicap 
towards 
educational 
needs 
arising 
from 
learning 
difficulties
EOS
none 
the 
less
there 
remains 
a 
focus 
upon 
the 
child 
as 
having 
needs 
rather 
than 
upon 
the 
situation 
as 
creating 
needs 
oliver

EOS
an 
important 
implication 
of 
this 
is 
that 
while 
a 
particular 
situation 
may 
give 
rise 
to 
various 
differing
and 
sometimes 
conflicting 
needs 
the 
needs 
of

the 
conceptual

upon 
the

the

inhibits 
the 
development 
of 
a 
theoretical 
framework 
within 
which 
the 
interplay 
of 
needs 
can 
be 
examined
EOS
on 
the 
other 
hand
psychologists 
frequently 
have 
the 
task 
of 
mediating 
between 
the 
needs 
and 
interests 
of 
the 
different 
participants 
involved 
with 
the

their 
key 
role 
in 
the 
decision-making 
process
EOS
despite 
the 
rights
parents 
are 
given 
under 
the 
act 
this 
is 
a 
form 
of 
power 
that 
parents 
are 
rarely 
able 
to 
exercise
EOS
parental 
involvement 
in 
decision-making 
is 
often 
restricted 
to 
identifying 
those 
aspects 
of 
the 
child
's 
behaviour 
that 
fit 
or 
do 
not 
fit 
with 
the 
views 
of 
the 
professionals
EOS
parents 
are 
marginalised
not 
because 
professionals 
deliberately 
exclude 
them 
but 
because 
they 
are 
denied 
the 
opportunity 
to 
influence 
how 
need 
is 
conceptualised
EOS
moreover
in 
practice
they 
may 
lack 
the 
power 
to 
negotiate 
on 
equal 
terms 
with 
professionals 
about 
the 
interrelationship 
between 
the

by 
conceptualising 
the 
child

in 
a 
way 
that 
fails 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
significance 
of 
this 
wider 
context 
the 
act 
reinforces 
and 
legitimises 
the 
disempowerment 
of 
parents
EOS
we 
can 
see 
how 
this 
occurred 
in 
our 
first 
two 
case 
studies
EOS
in 
both 
cases 
the 
parents
' 
resignation 
to 
the 
inevitability 
of 
the 
assessment 
outcome 
arose 
from 
their 
having 
no 
opportunity 
to 
determine 
or 
seriously 
influence 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
assessment 
nor 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
conceptual 
framework 
within 
which 
their 
children
's 
needs 
were 
being 
assessed
EOS
in 
the 
third 
case 
mrs

refused 
to 
accept 
the 
proposals 
put 
forward 
by 
the 
professionals 
for 
meeting 
tom
's 
needs
EOS
whereas 
at 
first 
she 
had 
welcomed 
the 
assessment 
she 
later 
came 
to 
the 
view 
that 
she 
was 
being 
given 
no 
say 
in 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
assessment
EOS
she
too
felt 
that 
she 
was 
denied 
the 
opportunity 
to 
make 
a 
genuine 
contribution
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
professionals
to 
the 
understanding 
of 
tom
's 
needs 
and 
the 
circumstances 
in 
which 
they 
were 
being 
created
EOS
ultimately
this 
led 
her 
to 
challenge 
the 
way 
the 
professionals 
conceived 
tom
's 
needs
EOS
in 
her 
eyes
she 
could 
only 
do 
so 
by 
stepping 
outside 
the 
framework 
imposed 
by 
the 
act
EOS
her 
direct 
challenge 
to 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
professionals 
forced 
them 
to 
acknowledge 
an 
alternative 
conceptualisation 
of 
tom
's 
needs 
which 
carried 
with 
it 
quite 
different 
implications 
for 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
formal 
assessment 
of 
those 
needs
EOS
in 
addition 
her 
action 
outside 
the 
assessment  
procedures 
also 
gave 
mrs 
jones 
the 
power 
to 
negotiate 
with 
other 
participants
EOS
by 
securing 
the 
support 
of 
the 
head 
teacher 
and 
staff 
of 
a 
different 
mainstream 
school 
she 
was 
able 
to 
place 
her 
opposition 
to 
a 
recommendation 
for 
residential 
schooling 
on 
a 
firm 
footing 
and 
insist 
that 
her 
understanding 
of 
tom

needs 
be 
tested 
in 
practice
EOS
thus 
mrs 
jones
's 
power 
inside 
the

was 
increased 
by 
her 
having

in 
the 
passage 
just 
cited 
for 
example 
it 
is 
striking 
that 
cixous 
includes 
the 
hegelian 
dialectic 
in 
the 
forms 
of 
political 
oppression 
which 
she 
describes
EOS
it 
is 
not 
a 
question 
of 
showing 
that 
such 
an 
allegation 
misinterprets 
or 
simplifies 
hegel
's 
texts
EOS
of 
course 
it 
does
EOS
the 
problem 
involves 
rather 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
hegel 
has 
been 
read
absorbed 
and 
adapted
EOS
nor 
is 
it 
just 
the 
hegelian 
dialectic 
as 
such
cixous 
includes 
history
and 
by 
implication 
therefore 
marxism 
as 
well
EOS
this 
can
not 
simply 
be 
dismissed 
as 
another 
new 
right 
invocation 
of 
the 
gulag
for 
cixous 
is 
arguing 
something 
much 
more 
specific
that 
marxism
insofar 
as 
it 
inherits 
the 
system 
of 
the 
hegelian 
dialectic
is 
also 
implicated 
in 
the 
link 
between 
the 
structures 
of 
knowledge 
and 
the 
forms 
of 
oppression 
of 
the 
last 
two 
hundred 
years
a 
phenomenon 
that 
has 
become 
known 
as 
eurocentrism
EOS
to 
this 
extent
marxism
's 
universalizing 
narrative 
of 
the 
unfolding 
of 
a 
rational 
system 
of 
world 
history 
is 
simply 
a 
negative 
form 
of 
the 
history 
of 
european 
imperialism
it 
was 
hegel
after 
all
who 
declared 
that 
africa 
has 
no 
history
and 
it 
was 
marx 
who
though 
critical 
of 
british 
imperialism
concluded 
that 
the 
british 
colonization 
of 
india 
was 
ultimately 
for 
the 
best 
because 
it 
brought 
india 
into 
the 
evolutionary 
narrative 
of 
western 
history
thus 
creating 
the 
conditions 
for 
future 
class 
struggle 
there
EOS
such 
an 
arrogant 
and 
arrogating 
narrative 
means 
that 
the 
story 
of 
world 
history
not 
only 
involves 
what 
fredric 
jameson 
describes 
as 
the 
wresting 
of 
freedom 
from 
the 
realm 
of 
necessity 
but 
always 
also 
the 
creation
subjection

final

EOS
this 
is 
why 
history
which 
for 
marxism 
promises 
liberation
for 
cixous 
also 
entails 
another 
forgotten 
story 
of 
oppression

politics

for

has 
not 
helped

separate

the

that 
of

the

often 
been 
defended 
on 
the

that 
they 
only 
describe 
the 
current 
customs

patriarchal 
society
EOS
but 
this 
does 
not 
alter 
the 
fact 
that 
psychoanalysis 
therefore 
repeats 
the 
same 
masculine 
empire 
of 
the 
selfsame

that 
as 
soon 
as 
such 
descriptions 
become 
institutionalized 
as 
a 
structure 
of 
knowledge

as 
psychoanalytic 
practice 
then 
they 
become 
agents 
of 
the

they 
describe
EOS
the 
point 
is 
to 
change 
it
EOS
but 
why 
this 
emphasis 
on 
hegel
EOS
the 
problem 
of 
the 
hegelian 
model
particularly 
of 
a 
historicism 
which 
presupposes 
a 
governing 
structure 
of 
self-realization 
in 
all 
historical 
process
is 
by 
no 
means 
confined 
to 
post-war 
french 
marxism
but 
the 
dominance 
of 
hegelian 
marxism 
from 
the 
thirties 
to 
the 
fifties 
does 
explain 
the 
particular 
context 
for 
the 
french 
poststructuralist 
assault
EOS
here 
it 
is 
not 
a 
question 
of 
suggesting 
that 
hegel 
is 
somehow 
answerable 
for 
the 
excesses 
of 
capitalism 
or 
even 
socialism 
in 
the 
past 
two 
hundred 
years
rather 
what 
is 
at 
stake 
is 
the 
argument 
that 
the 
dominant 
force 
of 
opposition 
to 
capitalism
marxism
as 
a 
body 
of 
knowledge 
itself 
remains 
complicit 
with

even 
extends
the 
system 
to 
which 
it 
is 
opposed
EOS
hegel 
articulates 
a 
philosophical 
structure 
of 
the 
appropriation 
of 
the 
other 
as 
a 
form 
of 
knowledge 
which 
uncannily 
simulates 
the 
project 
of 
nineteenth-century 
imperialism
the 
construction 
of 
knowledges 
which 
all 
operate 
through 
forms 
of 
expropriation 
and 
incorporation 
of 
the 
other 
mimics 
it 
a 
conceptual 
level 
the 
geographical 
and 
economic 
absorption 
of 
the 
non-european 
world 
by 
the 
west
EOS
marxism
's 
standing 
hegel 
on 
his 
head 
may 
have 
reversed 
his 
idealism
but 
it 
did 
not 
change 
the 
mode 
of 
operation 
of 
a 
conceptual 
system 
which 
remains 
collusively 
eurocentric
EOS
it 
is 
thus 
entirely 
appropriate 
that 
hegelian 
marxism 
has 
become 
generally 
known 
as 
western 
marxism
EOS
as 
cixous 
suggests
the 
mode 
of

as 
a 
politics

at 
a 
theoretical 
level 
on 
the 
dialectic

such 
knowledge 
is

it 
is 
outward 
looking
searching

power

foreseen 
by

history
with 
a 
capital

not 
tolerate 
otherness

leave 
it 
outside 
its

EOS
the 
appropriation 
of 
the 
other 
as 
a 
form 
of 
knowledge 
within 
a 
totalizing

thus 
be

the 
project
of

the

as

the 
reaction 
against 
this 
structure 
has 
produced 
forms 
of 
politics 
that 
do 
not 
fit 
into 
traditional 
political 
categories
EOS
here 
the 
problem 
rests 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
for 
orthodox 
marxism 
there 
can 
be 
only 
one 
other
that 
of 
the

class
into 
which 
all 
other 
oppressed

so-called

must 
in 
the 
last 
instance 
be 
subsumed
EOS
such 
a 
position 
is 
by 
no 
means 
confined 
to 
a 
marxism 
of 
a 
stalinist 
past
EOS
in 
making 
history 
published 
in 
1987
for 
example
alex 
callinicos 
argues 
that 
the 
so-called 
poststructuralist 
critique 
of 
the 
category 
of 
the 
subject 
can 
be 
avoided 
by 
shifting 
the 
subject 
out 
of 
the 
problematic 
realm 
of 
consciousness 
into 
a 
theory 
of 
human 
agency
EOS
this 
provides 
something 
closer 
to 
historical 
marxism
although 
it 
does 
mean 
that 
he 
quickly 
becomes 
involved 
in 
assumptions 
about 
rationality 
and 
intentionality
and 
has 
to 
propose 
a 
principle 
of 
humanity
that 
is 
a 
common 
human 
nature
to 
hold 
them 
all 
together
EOS
perhaps 
not 
unexpectedly
the 
principle 
of 
humanity
also 
turns 
out 
to 
involve 
the 
assumption 
that 
class 
is 
the 
primary 
form 
of 
collective 
agency
because
we 
are 
told
it 
is 
more 
fundamental 
than 
any 
other 
interests

forms 
of 
social 
power
EOS
callinicos 
writes
EOS
feminists 
and 
black 
nationalists 
sic
often 
complain 
that 
the 
concepts 
of 
marxist 
class 
theory 
are 
gender-blind
and 
race-blind

this 
is 
indeed 
true

EOS
but 
of 
itself 
this 
does 
not 
provide 
grounds 
for 
rejecting 
marxism
since 
its 
chief 
theoretical 
claim 
is 
precisely 
to 
explain 
power-relations

forms 
of 
conflict 
such 
as 
those 
denoted 
by

nation
gender
and 
race
in

of 
the 
forces 
and 
relations 
of

EOS
the 
mere 
existence 
of 
national
sexual 
and 
racial 
oppression 
does 
not 
refute 
historical 
materialism
but 
rather 
constitutes 
its 
explanandum 
EOS
the 
only 
interesting 
question 
is 
whether

not 
marxism 
can 
actually 
explain 
these 
phenomena
EOS
the 
only 
interesting 
question
EOS
so 
as 
long 
as 
gender 
and 
race 
can 
be 
satisfactorily 
subordinated 
to 
class 
then 
marxism 
does 
not 
need 
refuting
and 
history 
can 
be 
reasserted 
as 
the 
single 
narrative 
of 
the 
third 
international
EOS
conversely
as 
callinicos 
implicitly 
recognizes
the 
problem 
with  
contemporary 
politics 
for 
the 
left 
is 
that 
the 
dialectic 
of 
class 
depends 
on 
a 
historicist 
history

vice 
versa
any 
failure 
of 
the 
former 
necessarily

waning

latter
EOS
marxism
's 
inability 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
political 
interventions 
of 
other 
oppositional 
groups 
has 
meant 
that 
its 
history 
can 
no 
longer 
claim 
to 
subsume 
all 
processes 
of 
change
EOS
the 
straightforward 
oppositional 
structure 
of 
capital 
and 
class 
does 
not 
necessarily 
work 
any 
more
if 
we 
think 
in 
terms 
of 
hegel
's 
master/slave 
dialectic
then 
rather 
than 
the 
working 
class 
being 
the 
obvious 
universal 
subject-victim
many 
others 
are 
also 
oppressed
particularly 
women
black

all 
other 
so-called 
ethnic

minority 
groups

any

individual 
may 
belong

several 
of 
these

the 
forms 
of 
oppression

of 
resistance

change
may 
not 
only 
overlap

may 
also 
differ

even 
conflict
EOS
as 
soon 
as 
there 
is 
no

a 
single 
master

no 
single

then 
the 
classic 
hegelian 
reversal 
model 
on 
which 
marxism 
depends 
and 
on 
which 
it 
bases 
its 
theory

revolution 
literally
an 
overturning

no

adequate
EOS
in 
fact 
it 
is 
arguable 
whether 
such 
dualistic 
conditions 
ever 
existed 
anyway
marginal 
groups 
which 
could 
not 
be 
assimilated 
into 
the 
category 
of 
the 
working 
class 
were 
merely 
relegated 
by 
marx 
to 
the 
lumpenproletariat 
EOS
even 
the 
formulation 
of 
a 
dualistic 
class 
division
laclau 
and 
mouffe 
have 
argued 
persuasively
is 
itself 
nothing 
less 
than 
a 
nostalgic 
attempt 
to 
recreate 
for 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
the 
imagined 
simplicity 
of 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
aristocracy/bourgeoisie 
conflict 
of 
the 
french 
revolution 
which 
had 
originally 
inspired 
hegel
EOS
a 
similarly 
straightforward 
opposition 
also 
provides 
much 
of 
the 
attraction 
which 
has 
fuelled 
the 
recent 
growth 
of 
interest 
in 
the 
historical 
analysis 
of 
colonialism 
in 
which 
you 
apparently 
have 
the 
simple 
binary 
of 
master

slave
colonizer

colonized
EOS
with 
colonialism 
it
's 
easy 
to 
tell 
the 
good 
guys 
from 
the 
bad 
guys
which 
makes 
it 
tempting 
to 
substitute 
the 
colonized 
for 
the 
lost 
working 
class
EOS
already 
in 
1957 
roland 
barthes 
was 
claiming 
that 
today 
it 
is 
the 
colonized 
peoples 
who 
assume 
the 
full 
ethical 
and 
political 
condition 
described 
by 
marx 
as 
being 
that 
of 
the 
proletariat
EOS
but 
politics 
today 
are 
much 
more 
complex
much 
more 
difficult 
to 
disentangle
EOS
the 
dialectical 
structure 
of 
oppositional 
politics 
no 
longer 
works 
for 
the 
micro-politics 
of 
the 
post-war 
period 
in 
the 
west
EOS
this 
is 
the 
context 
of 
foucault
's 
critique 
of 
what 
he 
calls 
the 
sovereign 
model 
of 
power
of 
the 
idea 
that 
power 
has 
a 
single 
source 
in 
a 
master
king
or 
class 
and 
can 
thus 
easily 
be 
reversed
EOS
this 
shift 
from 
a 
conflictual 
dyadic 
political 
structure 
is 
not 
simply 
a 
question 
of 
historical 
change
of 
the 
recent 
appearance 
of 
minorities
after 
all 
the 
slave 
was 
already 
constituted 
simultaneously 
according 
to 
different 
groups 
for 
example 
male 
or 
female
the 
lumpenproletariat 
always 
had 
to 
be 
excluded
EOS
the 
problem 
begins 
at 
a 
conceptual 
level 
with 
the 
initial 
division 
between 
master 
and 
slave 
as 
such
as 
if 
relations 
of 
power 
work 
according 
to 
the 
binary 
opposition 
of 
hegel
's 
fight 
to 
the 
death 
between 
two 
individuals

this 
structure 
is 
not
as 
might 
at 
first 
be 
imagined
derived 
from 
a 
fantasy 
of 
power 
relations 
modelled 
on 
a 
medieval 
joust 
but 
from 
the 
phenomenological 
account 
of 
the 
constitution 
of 
knowledge 
that 
works 
according 
to 
the 
structure 
of 
a 
subject 
perceiving 
an 
object
a 
same/other 
dialectic 
in 
which 
the 
other 
is 
first 
constituted 
by 
the 
same 
through 
its 
negation 
as 
other 
before 
being 
incorporated 
within 
it
EOS
no 
possibility 
of 
dialogue 
or 
exchange 
here
EOS
as 
cixous 
argues
nor 
can 
there 
be 
any 
place 
in 
this 
schema 
for 
the 
other 
as 
other
unless 
it 
becomes
like 
god
an 
absolute 
other
literally 
unknowable
EOS
the 
difficulties 
which 
arise 
from 
this 
structure 
are 
familiar 
from 
the 
debates 
in 
feminism
where
woman
seems 
to 
be 
offered 
an 
alternative 
of 
either 
being 
the 
other
as 
constituted 
by 
man
that 
is
conforming 
to 
the 
stereotypes 
of 
patriarchy
or
if 
she 
is 
to 
avoid 
this
of 
being 
an 
absolute 
other
outside 
knowledge
necessarily 
confined 
to 
inarticulate 
expressions 
of 
mysticism 
or 
jouissance 
EOS
the 
only 
way 
to 
side-step 
these 
alternatives 
seems 
to 
be 
to 
reject 
the 
other 
altogether 
and 
become 
the 
same
that 
is
equal 
to 
men 
but 
then 
with 
no 
difference 
from 
them
EOS
exactly 
the 
same 
double 
bind 
is 
encountered 
in 
any 
theorization 
of 
racial 
difference
EOS
in 
his 
influential 
le 
mÃªme 
et 
l'autre 
vincent 
descombes 
has 
described 
the 
entire 
history 
of 
twentieth-century 
philosophy 
in 
france 
as 
a 
succession 
of 
moves 
which 
attempt 
to 
get 
out 
of 
this 
hegelian 
dialectic
the 
recent 
phenomenon 
of 
poststructuralism 
is 
part 
of 
a 
long 
philosophical 
story 
and 
distinguished 
only 
by 
what 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
certain 
success
or 
at 
least 
an 
avoidance 
of 
failure 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
it 
has 
at 
least 
managed 
to 
keep 
the 
game 
with 
hegel 
in 
play
EOS
the 
real 
difficulty 
has 
always 
been 
to 
find 
an 
alternative 
to 
the 
hegelian 
dialectic 
difficult 
because 
strictly 
speaking 
it 
is 
impossible
insofar 
as 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
dialectic 
already 
includes 
its 
negation
EOS
you 
can
not 
get 
out 
of 
hegel 
by 
simply 
contradicting 
him
any 
more 
than 
you 
can 
get 
out 
of 
those 
other 
hegelian 
systems
marxism 
and 
psychoanalysis
by 
simply 
opposing 
them
for 
in 
both 
your 
opposition 
is 
likewise 
always 
recuperable
as 
the 
workings 
of 
ideology 
or 
psychic 
resistance
EOS
nor 
can 
you 
get 
away 
from 
hegel 
by 
simply 
removing 
him
like 
the 
excision 
of 
trotsky 
from 
the 
side 
of 
lenin 
in 
certain 
official 
soviet 
photographs
EOS
this 
is 
the 
lesson 
of 
althusser
EOS
althusser
's 
historical 
interest 
derives 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
represents 
the 
only 
orthodox 
marxist 
theorist 
who 
has 
tried 
to 
get 
out 
of 
hegel 
while 
remaining 
a 
marxist 
though 
for 
many 
marxists 
he 
did 
sacrifice 
marxism 
in 
the 
process
which 
only 
suggests 
how 
closely 
marxism 
and 
hegelianism 
are 
intertwined
EOS
althusser
's 
theoretical 
interest
on 
the 
other 
hand
is 
that 
he 
demonstrates 
the 
impossibility 
of 
any 
attempt 
simply 
to 
exclude
excise 
or 
extirpate 
hegel

EOS
if 
poststructuralism 
has 
involved 
an 
attempted 
disruption 
or 
reworking 
of 
hegelianism 
through 
the 
detection 
of 
its 
own 
fissures
it 
is 
not 
by 
any 
means 
unique 
in 
such 
an 
enterprise
EOS
for
as 
foucault 
argued 
in 
1978
the 
work 
of 
the 
frankfurt 
school 
could 
also 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
reassessment 
of 
hegelianism 
and 
the 
metaphysics 
of 
dialectical 
thought
EOS
however
it 
is 
too 
simplistic 
a 
reaction 
to 
suggest 
that 
french 
poststructuralism 
can 
therefore 
be 
invalidated 
by 
judging 
it 
against 
the 
claims 
of 
a 
comparable 
endeavour 
in 
germany
a 
procedure 
which 
can 
only 
operate 
by 
turning 
the 
former 
into 
a 
failed 
version 
of 
the 
latter
which 
obviously 
leaves 
open 
the 
possibility 
of 
exactly 
the 
reverse 
argument 
being 
made
EOS
though 
the 
two 
may 
have 
isolated 
similar 
problems
the 
political 
and 
intellectual 
context 
of 
their 
work 
was 
by 
no 
means 
the 
same
EOS
the 
key 
frankfurt 
school 
text 
in 
this 
regard 
is 
obviously 
horkheimer 
and 
adorno
's 
dialectic 
of 
enlightenment 
of 
1944
EOS
the 
date
and 
the 
exiled 
place 
of 
composition 
of 
its 
authors
suggests 
tellingly 
that 
the 
situation 
with 
which 
it 
attempts 
to 
deal 
is 
the 
phenomenon 
of 
fascism 
which 
seemed 
to 
have 
stopped 
in 
its 
tracks 
the 
long 
march 
of 
the 
progress 
of 
reason
and 
its 
liberating 
enlightenment 
ideals
of 
which 
marxism 
was 
the 
fullest 
political 
development
EOS
horkheimer 
and 
adorno 
therefore 
pose 
the 
question
how 
has 
the 
dialectic 
deviated 
into 
fascism
EOS
why 
has 
history 
gone 
wrong
EOS
their 
answer
briefly
was 
that 
reason 
had 
always 
contained 
a 
measure 
of 
irrationality
which
despite 
its 
best 
intentions
had 
led 
to 
its 
involvement 
with 
tyranny 
and 
domination
enlightenment 
is 
totalitarian
EOS
the 
very 
powers 
of 
rationality 
which 
enabled 
modern 
man 
to 
free 
himself 
from 
nature 
and 
control 
it 
had 
also 
become 
an 
instrumental 
device 
to 
dominate 
him
EOS
if 
nature 
had 
been 
modelled 
by 
man 
into 
productive 
commodities
man
's 
own 
subjectivity 
had 
also 
become 
reified 
into 
a 
self-identical 
instrument
man 
had 
become 
an 
empty 
and 
passive 
consumer
EOS
the 
project
therefore
was 
to 
return 
to 
the 
enlightenment 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
fascism
to 
excise 
the 
forms 
of 
instrumental 
rationality 
that 
had 
produced 
this 
self-defeating 
and
ironically
irrational 
dialectical 
structure 
of 
domination
and 
to 
redefine 
reason 
and 
the 
forms 
of 
identity 
thinking 
that 
had 
defined 
the 
individual 
simply 
as 
an 
indistinguishable 
element 
in 
the 
collective
EOS
in 
this 
way 
the 
autonomy 
and 
spontaneity 
of 
the 
individual 
subject 
that 
had 
been 
the 
original 
goal 
of 
enlightenment 
might 
be 
retrieved
EOS
if 
for 
the 
frankfurt 
school 
the 
problem 
to 
be 
dealt 
with 
was 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
phenomena 
of 
fascism
and 
particularly 
auschwitz
to 
the 
ideals 
of 
the 
enlightenment 
and 
the 
progress 
of 
reason
for 
the 
french  
poststructuralists 
the 
historical 
perspective 
was 
similarly 
long
EOS
but 
it 
comprised
rather
a 
history 
of 
the 
west 
in 
which 
fascism 
was 
itself 
merely 
a 
symptom
and 
included 
not 
only 
the 
history 
of 
european 
imperialism 
but 
also 
the 
defeats 
of 
the 
european 
colonial 
powers 
by 
japan 
in 
world 
war 
ii
the 
subsequent 
french 
and 
american
defeat 
in 
south-east 
asia
the 
war 
in 
algeria
as 
well 
as 
the 
many 
other 
colonial 
wars 
of 
national 
liberation
EOS
from 
this 
point 
of 
view 
the 
french 
have 
never 
regarded 
fascism 
as 
an 
aberration
concurring 
rather 
with 
cÃ©saire 
and 
fanon 
that 
it 
can 
be 
explained 
quite 
simply 
as 
european 
colonialism 
brought 
home 
to 
europe 
by 
a 
country 
that 
had 
been 
deprived 
of 
its 
overseas 
empire 
after 
world 
war 
i. 
french 
poststructuralism
therefore
involves 
a 
critique 
of 
reason 
as 
a 
system 
of 
domination 
comparable 
to 
that 
of 
the 
frankfurt 
school
but 
rather 
than 
setting 
up 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
purged 
reason 
operating 
in 
an 
unblocked
ideal 
speech 
situation 
as 
a 
defence 
against 
tyranny 
and 
coercion 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
a 
habermas
it 
reanalyses 
the 
operations 
of 
reason 
as 
such
EOS
here 
the 
focus 
is 
placed 
not 
so 
much 
upon 
the 
continued 
presence 
of 
irrationality
for 
irrationality 
after 
all 
is 
simply 
reason
's 
own 
excluded 
but 
necessary 
negative 
other
but 
rather 
on 
the 
possibility 
of 
other 
logics 
being 
imbricated 
within 
reason 
which 
might 
serve 
to 
undo 
its 
own 
tendency 
to 
domination
EOS
here 
we 
have 
a 
major 
difference 
from 
the 
historical 
pessimism 
of 
adorno
's 
negative 
dialectics 
which 
in 
certain 
respects 
poststructuralism 
might 
appear 
to 
resemble
EOS
another 
such 
project 
was 
initiated 
by 
adorno
's 
contemporary 
jean-paul 
sartre
whose 
attempt 
to 
define 
a 
new 
form 
of 
hegelian 
marxism 
via 
a 
reworked 
philosophy 
of 
consciousness 
in 
many 
ways 
more 
closely 
resembled 
that 
of 
the 
frankfurt 
school
EOS
in 
both 
cases 
revisionary 
work 
of 
this 
kind 
was 
embodied 
in 
a 
historical 
and 
political 
analysis 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
individual 
consciousness 
to 
society
from 
within 
the 
aegis 
of 
an 
hegelian 
marxism 
in 
some 
respects 
still 
impossibly 
bound 
to 
its 
own 
enlightenment 
heritage
EOS
this 
meant 
that 
adorno 
in 
particular 
tended 
to 
project 
science 
as 
something 
exterior 
and 
exclusively 
instrumental
he 
reacted 
against 
it
as 
well 
as
objective
reason 
generally
by 
trying 
to 
retrieve 
the 
individual 
subject 
as 
the 
means 
to 
salvation
EOS
in 
france
however
there 
also 
existed 
a 
very 
different 
tradition
that 
of 
the 
history 
of 
the 
sciences
a 
tradition 
in 
which 
foucault 
has 
placed 
himself
EOS
having 
been 
overshadowed 
since 
the 
war 
by 
sartrean 
marxism
in 
the 
crises 
of 
the 
1960s 
it 
emerged 
as 
the 
more 
influential 
of 
the 
two
EOS
foucault 
traces 
its 
history 
back 
to 
husserl
's 
cartesian 
meditations 
1929
and 
the 
crisis 
of 
the 
european 
sciences 
1936
in 
which 
husserl 
posed 
the 
question 
of 
the 
relations 
between 
the 
western
project 
of 
a 
universal 
deployment 
of 
reason
and
the 
positivity 
of 
the 
sciences 
and 
the 
radicality 
of 
philosophy'
EOS
this 
enabled 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
critical 
position 
in 
relation 
to 
science 
which 
for 
adorno 
remained 
so 
elusive
EOS
in 
larger 
terms
however
the 
questions 
posed 
in 
the 
french 
tradition 
were  
comparable 
to 
those 
of 
the 
frankfurt 
school
particularly 
the 
interrogation 
of 
rationality 
in 
its 
claims 
to 
universality
EOS
as 
foucault 
puts 
it
EOS
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
sciences 
in 
france
as 
in 
german 
critical 
theory
it 
is 
a 
matter 
at 
bottom 
of 
examining 
a 
reason
the 
autonomy 
of 
whose 
structures 
carries 
with 
it 
a 
history 
of 
dogmatism 
and 
despotism 
a 
reason
consequently
which 
can 
only 
have 
an 
effect 
of 
emancipation 
on 
condition 
that 
it 
manages 
to 
liberate 
itself 
from 
itself
EOS
54
EOS
the 
final 
emancipatory 
gesture 
of 
enlightenment 
thought 
would 
thus 
be 
its 
own 
liberation 
from 
itself
so 
that 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
recognizable 
as 
reason
EOS
but 
what 
was 
it 
that 
brought 
about 
the 
return 
of 
the 
question 
of 
the 
enlightenment 
to 
contemporary 
philosophical 
enquiry
EOS
foucault 
identifies 
three 
reasons
first 
of 
all 
the 
ever-increasing 
importance 
of 
technology
secondly 
the 
place 
of 
rationalism 
in 
the 
optimism 
attached 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
revolution
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
despotism 
that 
so 
often 
followed 
its 
realization 
and 
thirdly
EOS
the 
movement 
which
at 
the 
close 
of 
the 
colonial 
era
led 
it 
to 
be 
asked 
of 
the 
west 
what 
entitles 
its 
culture
its 
science
its 
social 
organization
and 
finally 
its 
rationality 
itself
to 
be 
able 
to 
claim 
universal 
validity
was 
this 
not 
a 
mirage 
associated 
with 
economic 
domination 
and 
political 
hegemony
EOS
two 
centuries 
later
the 
enlightenment 
returns
but 
not 
at 
all 
as 
a 
way 
for 
the 
west 
to 
take 
cognizance 
of 
its 
present 
possibilities 
and 
of 
the 
liberties 
to 
which 
it 
can 
have 
access
but 
as 
a 
way 
of 
interrogating 
it 
on 
its 
limits 
and 
on 
the 
powers 
which 
it 
has 
abused
EOS
reason

despotic

EOS

EOS
foucault
's 
account 
is 
particularly 
useful 
insofar 
as 
it 
gives 
a 
good 
indication 
of 
the 
characteristic 
french
as 
opposed 
to 
german
emphasis 
on 
the 
relation 
of 
marxism 
to 
enlightenment 
rationality 
and 
the 
questioning 
of 
enlightenment 
claims 
to 
the 
universality 
of 
its 
values
EOS
the 
first 
element
the 
role 
of 
science
is 
common 
to 
both
though 
they 
approach 
the 
question 
from 
opposite 
perspectives
EOS
the 
second
the 
role 
of 
enlightenment 
thinking 
in 
the 
subsequent 
history 
of 
european 
despotism
is 
the 
particular 
focus 
of 
interest 
for 
the 
german 
critical 
theorists
most 
memorably 
and 
most 
forcibly 
articulated 
in 
benjamin
's 
theses 
on 
the 
philosophy 
of 
history
EOS
it 
is 
the 
third 
element
however
which 
represents 
the 
special 
interest 
of 
the 
french
whether 
of 
the 
sartrean 
or 
foucauldian 
tradition
the 
relation 
of 
the 
enlightenment
its 
grand 
projects 
and 
universal 
truth-claims
to 
the 
history 
of 
european 
colonialism
EOS
this 
need 
not 
necessarily 
involve 
a 
direct 
analysis 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
colonialism 
as 
such
but 
can 
also 
consist 
of 
a 
relentless 
anatomization 
of 
the 
collusive 
forms 
of 
european 
knowledge
EOS
for 
foucault 
this 
has 
comprised 
a 
vigorous 
critique 
of 
historicism
including 
marxist 
historicism
and 
its 
relation 
to 
the 
operations 
of 
knowledge 
and 
power
EOS
it 
is 
from 
this 
perspective 
that 
it 
becomes 
possible 
to 
understand 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
distrust 
of 
totalizing 
systems 
of 
knowledge 
which 
depend 
upon 
theory 
and  
concepts
so 
characteristic 
of 
foucault 
or 
lyotard
both 
of 
whom 
have 
been 
predominantly 
concerned 
with 
the 
attempt 
to 
isolate 
and 
foreground 
singularity 
as 
opposed 
to 
universality
EOS
this 
quest 
for 
the 
singular
the 
contingent 
event 
which 
by 
definition 
refuses 
all 
conceptualization
can 
clearly 
be 
related 
to 
the 
project 
of 
constructing 
a 
form 
of 
knowledge 
that 
respects 
the 
other 
without 
absorbing 
it 
into 
the 
same
EOS
it 
is 
in 
the 
work 
of 
edward 
said 
that 
we 
can 
find 
the 
problematic 
of 
historicist 
forms 
of 
knowledge 
linked 
most 
forcibly 
to 
the 
question 
of 
european 
imperialism
EOS
he 
writes
EOS
so 
far 
as 
orientalism 
in

what
has 
never 
taken 
place 
is 
an 
epistemological 
critique 
at 
the 
most 
fundamental 
level 
of 
the 
connection 
between 
the 
development 
of 
a 
historicism 
which 
has 
expanded 
and 
developed 
enough 
to 
include 
antithetical 
attitudes 
such 
as 
ideologies 
of 
western 
imperialism 
and 
critiques 
of 
imperialism 
on 
the 
one 
hand
and 
on 
the 
other
the 
actual 
practice 
of 
imperialism 
by 
which 
the 
accumulation 
of 
territories 
and 
population
the 
control 
of 
economies
and 
the 
incorporation 
and 
homogenisation 
of 
histories 
are 
maintained
EOS
this 
was 
the 
difficult 
project 
of 
his 
own 
book
orientalism 
1978
which 
we 
shall 
later 
be 
examining 
in 
detail
EOS
for 
the 
moment 
let 
us 
focus 
on 
said
's 
subsequent 
point 
that 
if 
orientalism 
and 
anthropology 
derive 
from 
historicism
this 
is 
by 
no 
means 
a 
thing 
of 
the 
past
of 
more 
recent 
sciences
said 
singles 
out 
in 
particular 
that 
of 
world 
history 
as 
practised 
by 
braudel
wallerstein
anderson 
and 
wolf
which 
he 
contends 
is 
still 
derived 
from 
the 
enterprise 
of 
orientalism 
and 
its 
colluding 
companion 
anthropology
and 
which 
has 
refused 
to 
encounter 
and 
to 
interrogate 
its 
own 
relationship 
as 
a 
discipline 
to 
european 
imperialism
EOS
for 
said
the 
problem 
amounts 
simply 
to 
historicism 
and
the 
universalising 
and 
self-validating 
that 
has 
been 
endemic 
to 
it'
EOS
the 
theories 
of 
accumulation 
on 
a 
world 
scale
or 
the 
capitalist 
world 
state
or 
lineages 
of 
absolutism 
depend 
a
on 
the 
same 
displaced 
percipient 
and 
historicist 
observer 
who 
had 
been 
an 
orientalist 
or 
colonial 
traveller 
three 
generations 
ago
b
they 
depend 
also 
on 
a 
homogenising 
and 
incorporating 
world 
historical 
scheme 
that 
assimilated 
non-synchronous 
developments
histories
cultures
and 
peoples 
to 
it
and 
c
they 
block 
and 
keep 
down 
latent 
epistemological 
critiques 
of 
the 
institutional
cultural 
and 
disciplinary 
instruments 
linking 
the 
incorporative 
practice 
of 
world 
history 
with 
partial 
knowledges 
like 
orientalism 
on 
the 
one 
hand

with 
continued 
western

non-european

EOS
a 
new 
type 
of 
knowledge
said 
contends
must 
be 
produced 
that 
can 
analyse 
plural 
objects 
as 
such 
rather 
than 
offering 
forms 
of 
integrated 
understanding 
that 
simply 
comprehend 
them 
within 
totalizing 
schemas
EOS
already 
across 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
different 
activities 
he 
points 
to 
advances 
in 
the 
process 
of 
breaking 
up
dissolving 
and 
methodologically 
as 
well 
as 
critically 
reconceiving 
the 
unitary 
field 
ruled 
hitherto 
by 
orientalism
historicism
and 
what 
could 
be 
called 
essentialist 
universalism
EOS
in 
this 
last 
phrase
said 
thus 
links 
his 
critique 
of 
orientalism 
to 
other 
critiques
such 
as 
those 
of 
racism 
or 
of 
patriarchy
EOS
the 
more 
difficult 
question 
remains 
of 
what 
form 
this 
new 
kind 
of 
knowledge 
can 
take
EOS
here 
we 
return 
to 
the 
theoretical 
problem 
of 
how 
the 
other 
can 
be 
articulated 
as 
such
EOS
how 
can 
we 
represent 
other 
cultures
asks 
said
as 
lÃ©vi-strauss 
had 
done 
before 
him
EOS
his 
own 
dismissal 
of 
deconstruction 
as 
a 
merely 
textual 
practice 
means 
that 
he 
is 
himself 
at 
a 
loss 
when 
faced 
with 
the 
complex 
conceptual 
dialectics 
of 
the 
same 
and 
the 
other
EOS
as 
will 
be 
demonstrated 
with 
respect 
to 
orientalism 
itself
said 
can
not 
get 
out 
of 
the 
hegelian 
problematic 
that 
he 
articulates
and 
indeed 
tends 
himself 
to 
repeat 
the 
very 
processes 
that 
he 
criticizes
EOS
his 
advocacy 
of 
an 
analytic 
pluralism 
in 
itself 
does 
not 
solve
or 
even 
address
the 
conceptual 
problems
EOS
nevertheless
said
's 
comments 
suggest 
the 
wider 
significance 
of 
his 
project
EOS
the 
demise 
of 
an 
orthodox 
marxism 
may 
have 
left 
theory 
with 
a 
sense 
that 
everything 
is 
now 
in 
flux
that 
the 
old 
verities 
have 
gone
but 
it 
has 
also 
involved 
the 
important 
realization
articulated 
so 
forcibly 
by 
writers 
such 
as 
foucault 
or 
said
of 
the 
deep 
articulation 
of 
knowledge 
with 
power
EOS
the 
politics 
of 
poststructuralism 
forces 
the 
recognition 
that 
all 
knowledge 
may 
be 
variously 
contaminated
implicated 
in 
its 
very 
formal 
or 
objective
structures
EOS
this 
means 
that 
in 
particular 
colonial 
discourse 
analysis 
is 
not 
merely 
a 
marginal 
adjunct 
to 
more 
mainstream 
studies
a 
specialized 
activity 
only 
for 
minorities 
or 
for 
historians 
of 
imperialism 
and 
colonialism
but 
itself 
forms 
the 
point 
of 
questioning 
of 
western 
knowledge
's 
categories 
and 
assumptions
EOS
in 
the 
same 
way
fanon 
suggests 
that 
at 
the 
political 
level 
the 
so-called 
third 
world
constitutes 
the 
disruptive 
term 
for 
the 
european 
political 
dialectic 
of 
capitalism 
and 
socialism
EOS
everyone 
feels 
the 
need 
nowadays 
to 
qualify 
the 
term 
third 
world
stating 
quite 
correctly 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be 
taken 
to 
imply 
a 
homogeneous 
entity
EOS
the 
inadequateness 
of 
the 
term
however
insofar 
as 
it 
offers 
a 
univocal 
description 
of 
an 
extremely 
heterogeneous 
section 
of 
the 
world
also 
means 
that 
a 
suitable 
alternative 
general 
category 
can
not 
by 
definition 
be 
produced
EOS
in 
this 
situation
abject 
apologies 
in 
some 
respects 
remain 
complicit 
with 
the 
patronizing 
attitudes 
from 
which 
they 
attempt 
to 
disassociate 
themselves
EOS
for 
the 
third 
world
was 
invented 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
1955 
bandung 
conference
on 
the 
model 
of 
the 
french 
revolution
's 
third 
estate
and 
incorporating 
equally 
revolutionary 
ideals 
of 
providing 
a 
radical 
alternative 
to 
the 
hegemonic 
capitalist-socialist 
power  
blocks 
of 
the 
post-war 
period
EOS
the 
third 
world 
as 
a 
term 
needs 
to 
retrieve 
this 
lost 
positive 
sense 
even 
if 
today 
the 
political 
order 
has 
changed 
so 
that 
to 
some 
extent 
the 
various 
forms 
of 
islamic 
fundamentalism 
have 
taken 
over 
the 
role 
of 
providing 
a 
direct 
alternative 
to 
first 
and 
second 
world 
ideologies
EOS
third 
world
will
therefore
be 
used 
in 
this 
book 
without 
further
apology
or 
scare 
quotes
as 
a 
positive 
term 
of 
radical 
critique 
even 
if 
it 
also 
necessarily 
signals 
its 
negative 
sense 
of 
economic 
dependency 
and 
exploitation
EOS
iii 
the 
philosophical 
allergy
EOS
although 
said 
rejects 
them
and 
foucault 
characteristically 
does 
not 
mention 
them
the 
most 
effective 
ploys 
that 
have 
recently 
been 
played 
in 
this 
project 
of 
articulating 
another 
form 
of 
knowledge
of 
redefining 
the 
basis 
of 
knowledge 
as 
such
derive 
from 
a 
different 
although 
related 
body 
of 
work 
to 
that 
which 
foucault 
describes 
namely 
the 
phenomenological 
tradition 
of 
heidegger
levinas
and 
derrida
which
seemingly 
like 
all 
twentieth-century 
european 
philosophy
also 
traces 
its 
apparent 
origins 
back 
to 
husserl
EOS
as 
we 
have 
seen
the 
fundamental 
problem 
concerns 
the 
way 
in 
which 
knowledge 
and 
therefore 
theory
or 
history 
is 
constituted 
through 
the 
comprehension 
and 
incorporation 
of 
the 
other
EOS
this 
has 
led 
to 
a 
series 
of 
attempts 
to 
reinscribe 
a 
place 
for
and 
a 
relation 
with
the 
other 
as 
other
outside 
the 
sphere 
of 
mastery 
and 
therefore
logically 
speaking
both 
infinite 
and 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
knowledge
EOS
emmanuel 
levinas
for 
example
whose 
career 
has 
been 
long 
enough 
to 
have 
introduced 
husserl 
to 
sartre 
in 
the 
thirties 
and 
to 
have 
been 
able 
to 
reply 
to 
derrida 
in 
the 
seventies
proposes 
a 
rather 
different 
critique 
of 
such 
models 
of 
knowledge 
to 
those 
which 
we 
have 
encountered 
so 
far
EOS
according 
to 
levinas
EOS
western 
philosophy 
coincides 
with 
the 
disclosure 
of 
the 
other 
where 
the 
other
in 
manifesting 
itself 
as 
a 
being
loses 
its 
alterity
EOS
from 
its 
infancy 
philosophy 
has 
been 
struck 
with 
a 
horror 
of 
the 
other 
that 
remains 
other 
with 
an 
insurmountable 
allergy
EOS
hegel
's 
philosophy 
represents 
the 
logical 
outcome 
of 
this 
underlying 
allergy 
of 
philosophy
EOS
levinas 
objects 
to 
the 
implicit 
violence 
in 
the 
process 
of 
knowledge 
which 
appropriates 
and 
sublates 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
other 
into 
itself
EOS
but 
as 
we 
can 
see
he 
does 
not 
just 
blame 
hegel 
here
for 
according 
to 
levinas 
ontology 
itself 
is 
the 
problem
EOS
concerned 
to 
find 
a 
way 
to 
allow 
the 
other 
to 
remain 
as 
other
levinas 
therefore 
rejects 
not 
only 
hegel 
but 
husserl
heidegger 
and 
sartre 
also
and 
abjures 
ontology 
altogether
EOS
because 
ontology 
involves 
an 
ethico-political 
violence 
towards 
the 
other
always 
to 
some 
degree 
seen 
as 
a 
threat
levinas 
proposes 
ethics 
in 
its 
place
substituting 
a 
respect 
for 
the 
other 
for 
a 
grasping 
of 
it
and 
a 
theory 
of 
desire 
not 
as 
negation 
and 
assimilation 
but 
as 
infinite 
separation

a

self-consciously 
written 
under 
the 
shadow 
of 
two 
world
wars 
in 
which 
europe
at 
the 
limit 
of 
its 
attempt 
to 
devour 
the 
world
turned 
in 
on 
itself 
in 
two 
violent 
acts 
of 
self-consummation
levinas 
questions 
the 
accepted 
relation 
between 
morality 
and 
politics
EOS
it 
must 
always
he 
suggests
be 
possible 
to 
criticize 
politics 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
ethical
EOS
as 
althusser 
was 
keen 
to 
emphasize
according 
to 
marx 
morality 
works 
simply 
as 
a 
form 
of 
ideological 
control
and 
levinas 
concurs 
that 
everyone 
will 
readily 
agree 
that 
it 
is 
the 
highest 
importance 
to 
know 
whether 
we 
are 
not 
duped 
by 
morality
21
EOS
but
he 
argues
the 
placing 
of 
politics 
the 
art 
of 
foreseeing 
war 
and 
of 
winning 
it 
by 
every 
means
before 
morality 
overlooks 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
war 
constitutes 
the 
philosophical 
concept 
of 
being 
itself
EOS
for 
being 
is 
always 
defined 
as 
the 
appropriation 
of 
either 
difference 
into 
identity
or 
of 
identities 
into 
a 
greater 
order
be 
it 
absolute 
knowledge
history
or 
the 
state
EOS
for 
its 
part
violence 
involves 
not 
just 
physical 
force
injuring 
or 
annihilating 
persons
but 
also
EOS
interrupting 
their 
continuity
making 
them 
play 
roles 
in 
which 
they 
no 
longer 
recognize 
themselves
making 
them 
betray 
not 
only 
commitments 
but 
their 
own 
substance
EOS
not 
only 
modern 
war 
but 
every 
war 
employs 
arms 
that 
turn 
against 
those 
who 
wield 
them
EOS
it 
establishes 
an 
order 
from 
which 
no 
one 
can 
keep 
his 
distance
nothing 
henceforth 
is 
exterior
EOS
21
EOS
war
then
is 
another 
form 
of 
the 
appropriation 
of 
the 
other
and 
underpins 
all 
ontological 
thinking 
with 
its 
violence
EOS
its 
corollary
or 
visage
is 
the 
concept 
of 
totality
which
as 
levinas 
observes
has 
dominated 
western 
philosophy 
in 
its 
long 
history 
of 
desire 
for 
unity 
and 
the 
one
EOS
through 
the 
totality
itself 
a 
kind 
of 
rational 
self 
writ 
large
the 
individual 
takes 
on 
meaning
the 
present 
is 
sacrificed 
to 
a 
future 
which 
will 
bring 
forth 
an 
ultimate
objective 
meaning 
when 
the 
totality 
of 
history 
is 
realized
EOS
the 
objection 
therefore 
to 
totalization 
is 
not 
founded 
on 
any 
simple 
analogy 
with 
totalitarianism 
though 
neither 
can 
this 
be 
excluded 
but 
rather 
on 
the 
implicit 
violence 
of 
ontology 
itself
in 
which 
the 
same 
constitutes 
itself 
through 
a 
form 
of 
negativity 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
other
producing 
all 
knowledge 
by 
appropriating 
and 
sublating 
the 
other 
within 
itself
EOS
as 
levinas 
puts 
it
the 
idea 
of 
truth 
as 
a 
grasp 
on 
things 
must 
necessarily 
have 
a 
non-metaphorical 
sense 
somewhere
EOS
in 
western 
philosophy
when 
knowledge 
or 
theory 
comprehends 
the 
other
then 
the 
alterity 
of 
the 
latter 
vanishes 
as 
it 
becomes 
part 
of 
the 
same
EOS
this 
ontological 
imperialism
levinas 
argues
goes 
back 
at 
least 
to 
socrates 
but 
can 
be 
found 
as 
recently 
as 
heidegger
EOS
in 
all 
cases 
the 
other 
is 
neutralized 
as 
a 
means 
of 
encompassing 
it
ontology 
amounts 
to 
a 
philosophy 
of 
power
an 
egotism 
in 
which 
the 
relation 
with 
the 
other 
is 
accomplished 
through 
its 
assimilation 
into 
the 
self
EOS
its 
political 
implications 
are 
clear 
enough
EOS
heidegger
with 
the 
whole 
of 
western 
history
takes 
the 
relation 
with 
the 
other 
as 
enacted 
in 
the 
destiny 
of 
sedentary 
peoples
the 
possessors 
and 
builders 
of 
the

EOS
possession 
is 
preeminently

the

EOS
46
EOS
ontology
therefore
though 
outwardly 
directed
remains 
always 
centred 
in 
an 
incorporating 
self
this 
imperialism 
of 
the 
same
levinas 
suggests
is 
the 
whole 
essence 
of 
freedom
87
EOS
for 
freedom 
is 
maintained 
by 
a 
self-possession 
which 
extends 
itself 
to 
anything 
that 
threatens 
its 
identity
EOS
in 
this 
structure 
european 
philosophy 
reduplicates 
western 
foreign 
policy
where 
democracy 
at 
home 
is 
maintained 
through 
colonial 
or 
neocolonial 
oppression 
abroad
EOS
levinas 
opposes 
freedom
based 
on 
self-interest
to 
justice
which 
respects 
the 
alterity 
of 
the 
other 
and 
can 
only 
be 
proposed 
through 
the 
asymmetry 
of 
dialogue
EOS
this 
also 
implies 
an 
interrogation 
of 
the 
imperialism 
of 
theory 
itself
EOS
for 
theory
as 
a 
form 
of 
knowledge 
and 
understanding 
of 
the 
spectator
is 
constitutively 
unable 
to 
let 
the 
other 
remain 
outside 
itself
outside 
its 
representation 
of 
the 
panorama 
which 
it 
surveys
in 
a 
state 
of 
singularity 
or 
separation
EOS
this 
will 
also 
be 
true 
of 
any 
concept
because 
by 
definition 
the 
concept 
can
not 
capture 
the 
absolutely-other

to 
the 
extent

it 
must 
invoke 
a

the 
other

an 
act 
of 
violence

reduction
EOS
this 
leads 
levinas 
to 
denounce 
the 
inability 
of 
theory
in 
its 
drive 
to 
comprehension 
and 
representation
to 
do 
justice 
to 
any 
radical 
exteriority
EOS
but 
how 
can 
we 
know 
and 
respect 
the 
other
EOS
is 
there 
a 
means 
of 
bridging 
the 
gap 
between 
knowledge 
and 
morality 
that 
avoids 
the 
problems 
of 
kant
's 
recourse 
to 
the 
aesthetic 
but 
also 
resists 
lyotard
's 
argument 
that 
the 
two 
are 
simply 
incommensurable
EOS
how 
can 
levinas
' 
ethics 
work 
differently 
from 
ontology
EOS
against 
the 
egotism 
of 
the 
preoccupation 
of 
being 
with 
itself
he 
posits 
a 
relation 
of 
sociality
whereby 
the 
self 
instead 
of 
assimilating 
the 
other 
opens 
itself 
to 
it 
through 
a 
relation 
with 
it
EOS
in 
the 
place 
of 
the 
correlation 
of 
knowledge 
with 
vision 
and 
light
the 
visual 
metaphor 
by 
which 
the 
adequation 
of 
the 
idea 
with 
the 
thing 
has 
been 
thought 
from 
plato 
to 
heidegger
levinas 
proposes 
language
which 
in 
the 
form 
of 
speech 
enables 
a 
kind 
of 
invisible 
contact 
between 
subjects 
that 
leaves 
them 
both 
intact
EOS
language
however
should 
take 
the 
form 
of 
dialogue
whereas 
the 
universality 
of 
reason 
means 
that 
it 
must 
necessarily 
renounce 
all 
singularity
and 
whereas 
language
's 
function 
in 
conceptualizing 
thought 
is 
to 
suppress 
the 
other 
and 
bring 
it 
within 
the 
aegis 
of 
the 
same
in 
dialogue 
language 
maintains 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
two
their 
commerce
as 
levinas 
puts 
it
is 
ethical
EOS
dialogism 
allows 
for 
radical 
separation
the 
strangeness 
of 
the 
interlocutors
the 
revelation 
of 
the 
other 
to 
me
73
EOS
the 
structure 
of 
dialogue
moreover
disallows 
the 
taking 
up 
of 
any 
position 
beyond 
the  
interlocutors 
from 
which 
they 
can 
be 
integrated 
into 
a 
larger

the

between 
them
therefore
is 
not 
oppositional
nor 
limitrophe

one 
of 
alterity
EOS

EOS
for 
totalization 
is 
accomplished 
only 
in

the 
historiographer 
assimilates 
all

punctual 
moments

the 
time

chronological 
order
it

the

analogous

55
EOS
if 
history 
claims 
to 
incorporate 
the 
other 
within 
a 
larger 
impersonal 
spirit 
or 
idea
albeit 
the 
ruse 
of

levinas 
contends 
that 
this 
alleged 
integration 
is 
cruelty 
and 
injustice
that 
is
it
ignores 
the 
other
52
EOS
history 
is 
the 
realm

it

the

transcendence
the

concretely 
produced

the 
ethics

the 
critical 
essence

43
EOS
metaphysics 
therefore 
precedes 
ontology
EOS
though 
a 
troubling 
term
metaphysics 
for 
levinas 
names 
a 
counter-tradition 
in 
philosophy 
in 
which 
the 
idea 
of 
infinity 
breaches 
all 
totality 
because 
it 
is 
a 
relationship 
with 
a 
surplus 
always 
exterior 
to 
the 
totality 
22
EOS
this 
surplus 
is 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
radical 
alterity 
of 
the 
other
whether 
as 
face
or 
as 
death
which 
prevents 
the 
totality 
from 
being 
constituted 
as 
such
EOS
as 
might 
be 
expected
it 
is 
the 
possibility 
of 
this 
absolute 
otherness
and 
the 
ability 
to 
excise 
all 
violence 
in 
the 
relation 
with 
it
which 
derrida 
questions 
in 
the 
first 
of 
his 
discussions 
of 
levinas
EOS
whereas 
levinas
like 
habermas
posits 
an 
authentic 
language 
of 
expression 
which 
abhors 
the 
distortions 
of 
rhetoric
derrida 
argues 
that 
such 
alterity 
is 
constituted 
not 
through 
dialogue 
but 
rather 
through 
the 
operation 
of 
language 
itself
levinas
' 
transcendence-as-surplus 
is 
therefore 
redefined 
as 
a 
derridean 
supplement
EOS
this 
would 
mean 
that 
there 
can 
never 
be 
an 
authentic 
speech 
of 
the 
other 
as 
such
a 
position 
which 
certainly 
troubles 
levinas
' 
fundamental 
argument
EOS
despite 
their 
differences
derrida
's 
keen 
interest 
in 
levinas
as 
christopher 
norris 
has 
argued 
in 
scrupulously 
non-derridean 
terms
points 
to 
the 
ultimately 
ethical 
nature 
of 
his 
enterprise
EOS
the 
early 
essay 
on 
levinas
dating 
from 
1964
shows 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
derrida 
has 
been 
implicated 
in 
such 
questions 
from 
the 
first 
though
contra 
norris
he 
has 
always 
shown 
that 
the 
conditions 
of 
writing
that 
make 
ethics 
possible 
also 
makes 
them 
impossible
EOS
certain 
orientations 
of 
his 
work 
can 
be 
affiliated 
to 
levinas
' 
attempt 
to 
shift 
the 
relation 
to 
alterity 
from 
an 
appropriation 
by 
the 
same 
into 
its 
totality 
to 
a 
respect 
for 
the 
other
's 
heterogeneity
EOS
derrida 
has 
even 
described 
the 
critique 
of 
logocentrism 
as 
above 
all 
else 
the 
search 
for 
the 
other
EOS
this 
can 
be 
related 
to 
the 
concern 
in 
derrida
's 
work 
with 
the 
politics 
of 
feminism 
and 
other 
positions 
which 
contest 
institutional 
and 
political 
appropriation 
and 
exclusion
EOS
in 
recent 
years 
levinas 
has 
himself 
articulated 
more 
explicitly 
his 
account 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
ethical 
to 
the 
political
EOS
if 
there 
were 
just 
two
as 
in 
the 
face-to-face 
dialogue
then 
the 
ethical 
would 
preside 
as 
the 
injunction 
of 
responsibility 
for 
the 
other
EOS
but 
as 
soon 
as 
there 
are 
three
he 
suggests
then 
the 
ethical 
moves 
into 
politics
EOS
we 
can 
never
levinas 
concedes 
to 
derrida
completely 
escape 
from 
the 
language 
of 
ontology 
and 
politics
EOS
but 
this 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
the 
ethical 
has 
to 
renounce 
the 
moral 
order 
in 
the 
political 
world 
of 
the 
third 
person 
of 
justice
of 
government
institutions
or 
the 
law
EOS
the 
political 
can 
retain 
an 
ethical 
foundation
levinas 
finds 
his 
example 
for 
this
unexpectedly
in 
marx
's 
famous 
comment 
on 
idealist 
philosophers 
that 
the 
point 
is 
not 
to 
describe 
the 
world 
but 
to 
change 
it
EOS
in 
marx
's 
critique 
we 
find 
an 
ethical 
conscience 
cutting 
through 
the 
ontological 
identification 
of 
truth 
with 
an 
ideal 
intelligibility 
and 
demanding 
that 
theory 
be 
converted 
into 
a 
concrete 
praxis 
of 
concern 
for 
the 
other
EOS
from 
this 
perspective 
levinas 
proposes 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
much 
lamented 
subject
be 
brought 
back 
not 
as 
the 
ontological 
subject 
which 
seeks 
to 
reduce 
everything 
to 
itself 
but 
as 
an 
ethical 
subject 
defined 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
other
ethics 
redefines 
subjectivity 
as 
this 
heteronomous 
responsibility 
in 
contrast 
to 
autonomous 
freedom
EOS
we 
might 
compare 
this 
ethical 
relation 
to 
cixous
' 
remarks 
about 
the 
need 
to 
love 
the 
other 
or 
kristeva
's 
recent 
preoccupation 
with 
love 
which
from 
this 
perspective
hardly 
involves 
the 
sudden 
apostasy 
of 
which 
she 
has 
been  
accused
but 
rather 
as 
for 
levinas 
consists 
of 
a 
way 
of 
formulating 
a 
responsibility 
for 
the 
other
being-for-the-other
EOS
in 
each 
case 
these 
writers 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
be 
trying 
to 
place 
the 
other 
outside 
the 
sphere 
of 
mastery 
rather 
than 
in 
a 
relation 
of 
negation 
or 
of 
reduplication 
of 
the 
self
EOS
unlike 
a 
conventional 
ethics 
of 
altruism
such 
a 
relation 
remains 
one 
of 
alterity
EOS
there 
will 
always 
be 
some 
return 
for 
the 
self 
in 
any 
gift 
unless 
it 
can 
be 
articulated 
in 
an 
economy 
of 
ingratitude
a 
movement 
without 
return
EOS
unless
that 
is
philosophy 
can 
become 
dissemination
a 
work 
conceived 
radically 
is 
a 
movement 
of 
the 
same 
unto 
the 
other 
which 
never 
returns 
to 
the 
same 
EOS
to 
the 
story 
of 
ulysses
levinas 
opposes 
that 
of 
abraham 
who 
leaves 
his 
fatherland 
for 
ever
never 
to 
return
EOS
this 
figure 
of 
the 
diaspora 
returns 
us 
to 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
aspects 
of 
levinas
' 
formulation 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
ethical 
to 
the 
political
that 
is 
the 
connections 
which 
he 
makes 
between 
the 
structure 
of 
ontology 
and 
eurocentrism
the 
latter 
disqualified
as 
he 
puts 
it
by 
so 
many 
horrors
EOS
he 
connects 
the 
form 
of 
knowledge 
that 
is 
self-centred 
but 
directed 
outwards
philosophy 
as 
egology
quite 
explicitly 
with 
the 
appropriating 
narcissism 
of 
the 
west
EOS
so 
in 
the 
past 
few 
hundred 
years 
europe 
has 
been
as 
gayatri 
chakravorty 
spivak 
has 
suggested
constituted 
and 
consolidated 
as 
sovereign 
subject
indeed 
sovereign 
and 
subject
EOS
just 
as 
the 
colonized

been 
constructed 
according 
to 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
colonizer
's 
own 
self-image
as 
the 
self-consolidating 
other
so 
europe
EOS
consolidated 
itself 
as 
sovereign 
subject 
by 
defining 
its 
colonies 
as 
others
even 
as 
it 
constituted 
them
for 
purposes 
of 
administration 
and 
the 
expansion 
of 
markets
into 
programmed 
near-images 
of 
that 
very 
sovereign 
self
EOS
it 
is 
this 
sovereign 
self 
of 
europe 
which 
is 
today 
being 
deconstructed
showing 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
europe
's 
other 
has 
been 
a 
narcissistic 
self-image 
through 
which 
it 
has 
constituted 
itself 
while 
never 
allowing 
it 
to 
achieve 
a 
perfect 
fit
EOS
this 
can 
be 
allied 
to 
derrida
's 
critique 
of 
a 
certain 
fundamental 
europeanization 
of 
world 
culture
EOS
derrida 
has 
sometimes 
been 
criticized 
for 
the 
generality 
of 
phrases 
such 
as
the 
history 
of 
the 
west
or 
the 
claim 
that 
his 
work 
involves 
a 
critique 
of 
western 
metaphysics
EOS
although 
one 
of 
the 
earliest 
questions 
put 
to 
him 
in 
england 
concerned 
this 
category 
of 
the 
west
in 
the 
subsequent 
fervour 
that 
accompanied 
the 
transformation 
of 
derrida
's 
work 
into 
the 
method 
of 
deconstruction
this 
problem 
tended 
to 
slip 
out 
of 
view
EOS
in 
its 
largest 
and 
perhaps 
most 
significant 
perspective
deconstruction 
involves 
not 
just 
a 
critique 
of 
the 
grounds 
of 
knowledge 
in 
general
but 
specifically 
of 
the 
grounds 
of 
occidental 
knowledge
EOS
the 
equation 
of 
knowledge 
with 
what 
is 
called 
western 
thought
the 
thought 
whose 
destiny 
is 
to 
extend 
its 
domains 
while 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the 
west 
are 
drawn 
back
involves 
the 
very 
kind 
of 
assumption 
that 
derrida 
is 
interrogating 
and 
this 
is 
the 
reason 
for 
his  
constant 
emphasis 
on 
its 
being 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
west
in 
the 
same 
way 
foucault 
also 
emphasizes 
that 
he 
is 
specifically 
discussing 
the 
western 
episteme 
EOS
the 
assertion 
that 
derrida
's 
work 
incurs 
a 
form 
of 
relativism 
is 
thus 
exactly 
to 
the 
point
though 
its 
implications 
are 
rather 
different 
from 
those 
generally 
assumed 
in 
such 
a 
complaint
EOS
for 
we 
can 
say 
that 
deconstruction 
involves 
the 
decentralization 
and 
decolonization 
of 
european 
thought 
insofar 
as 
it 
is 
incapable 
of 
respecting 
the 
being 
and 
meaning 
of 
the 
other
and 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
its 
philosophical 
tradition 
makes 
common 
cause 
with 
oppression 
and 
with 
the 
totalitarianism 
of 
the 
same
EOS
this 
has 
been 
the 
significance 
of 
levinas
' 
thought 
for 
derrida
EOS
as 
he 
puts 
it 
in 
writing 
and 
difference 
at 
the 
very 
moment 
when 
the 
fundamental 
conceptual 
systems 
of 
europe 
are 
in 
the 
process 
of 
taking 
over 
all 
of 
humanity
levinas 
leads 
us 
instead 
to 
an 
inconceivable 
process 
of 
dismantling 
and 
dispossession
EOS
for 
levinas
' 
thought
EOS
seeks 
to 
liberate 
itself 
from 
the 
greek 
domination 
of 
the 
same 
and 
the 
one
as 
if 
from 
oppression 
itself 
an 
oppression 
certainly 
comparable 
to 
none 
other 
in 
the

an 
ontological 
or 
transcendental 
oppression

also 
the 
origin 
or 
alibi 
of 
all

EOS
this 
is 
the 
context 
in 
which 
to 
set 
derrida
's 
own 
intervention 
in 
of 
grammatology 
EOS
everyone 
knows 
that 
that 
book 
is 
a 
critique

often 
recalled

that 
the

the

attention 
on 
logocentrism

ethnocentrism 
which
derrida 
suggests
is 
nothing

the 
most 
original 
and 
powerful 
ethnocentrism
in 
the 
process 
of 
imposing 
itself 
upon 
the 
world
EOS
it 
is 
this 
preoccupation 
which 
accounts 
for 
derrida
's 
choice
and 
forceful 
interrogation
of 
the 
privileged 
examples 
of 
saussure 
where 
he 
focuses 
on 
the 
profound 
ethnocentrism
of 
his 
exclusion 
of 
writing 
rousseau 
and 
lÃ©vi-strauss
EOS
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
latter
derrida
's 
interest 
also 
focuses 
particularly 
on 
the 
way 
in 
which 
lÃ©vi-strauss 
produces 
his 
knowledge 
of 
a 
non-european 
civilization 
according 
to 
a 
doubled 
but 
non-contradictory 
logic 
which 
evades 
identity-thinking
EOS
the 
well-known 
deconstruction 
carried 
out 
in 
structure
sign
and 
play
shows 
how 
the 
constitution 
of 
anthropological 
knowledge
though 
often 
paraded 
as 
scientific 
and 
objective
is 
nevertheless 
governed 
by 
a 
problematic 
of 
which 
it 
remains 
unaware
the 
philosophical 
category 
of 
the 
centre 
which 
derrida 
then 
proceeds 
to 
articulate 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
eurocentrism
EOS
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
dialectics 
of 
the 
centre 
and 
the 
margin 
can 
thus 
operate 
geographically 
as 
well 
as 
conceptually
articulating 
the 
power 
relationships 
between 
the 
metropolitan 
and 
the 
colonial 
cultures 
at 
their 
geographical 
peripheries
EOS
this 
is 
not 
to 
suggest
however
that 
deconstruction 
in 
any 
sense 
brings 
another 
knowledge 
to 
bear
rather 
it 
involves 
a 
critique 
of 
western 
knowledge 
that 
works 
by 
exploiting 
the 
ambivalent 
resources 
of 
western 
writing
as 
if 
marxism 
were 
to 
produce 
a 
critique 
of 
ideology 
without 
the 
advantage 
of 
its  
science 
which
given 
the 
current 
ambiguous 
status 
of 
marxist 
science 
is 
not 
a 
possibility 
to 
be 
dismissed 
lightly
EOS
if 
one 
had 
to 
answer
therefore
the 
general 
question 
of 
what 
is 
deconstruction 
a 
deconstruction 
of
the 
answer 
would 
be
of 
the 
concept
the 
authority
and 
assumed 
primacy 
of
the 
category 
of 
the 
west
EOS
if 
deconstruction 
forms 
part 
of 
a 
more 
widespread 
attempt 
to 
decolonize 
the 
forms 
of 
european 
thought
from 
this 
perspective 
derrida
's 
work 
can 
be 
understood 
as 
characteristically 
postmodern
EOS
postmodernism 
can 
best 
be 
defined 
as 
european 
culture
's 
awareness 
that 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
unquestioned 
and 
dominant 
centre 
of 
the 
world
EOS
significantly 
enough 
one 
of 
the 
very 
earliest 
uses 
of 
the 
term 
postmodern
dating 
from 
the 
time 
of 
the 
second 
world 
war
was 
that 
of 
arnold 
toynbee 
in 
his 
a 
study 
of 
history 
EOS
he 
used 
it 
to 
describe 
the 
new 
age 
of 
western 
history 
which
according 
to 
toynbee
began 
in 
the 
1870s 
with 
the 
simultaneous 
globalization 
of 
western 
culture 
and 
the 
re-empowerment 
of 
non-western 
states
EOS
if 
this 
new 
period 
brought 
with 
it 
a 
phase 
of 
spenglerian 
pessimism 
after 
the 
long 
years 
of 
victorian 
optimism
toynbee 
did 
not 
himself 
assume 
that 
the 
west 
was 
in 
decline 
as 
such
but 
rather 
that 
paradoxically 
the 
globalization 
of 
western 
civilization 
was 
being 
accompanied 
by 
a 
self-consciousness 
of 
its 
own 
cultural 
relativization
a 
process 
to 
which 
toynbee
's 
own 
equally 
totalizing 
and 
relativizing 
history 
was 
designed 
to 
contribute
EOS
reviewing 
the 
genesis 
of 
his 
whole 
project
he 
recounts 
that 
his 
history 
was 
written
EOS
against 
a 
current 
late 
modern 
western 
convention 
of 
identifying 
a 
parvenu 
and 
provincial 
western 
society
's 
history 
with 
history
writ 
large
sans 
phrase 
EOS
in 
the 
writer
's 
view 
this 
convention 
was 
the 
preposterous 
off-spring 
of 
a 
distorting 
egocentric 
illusion 
to 
which 
the 
children 
of 
a 
western 
civilisation 
had 
succumbed 
like 
the 
children 
of 
all 
other 
known 
civilisations 
and 
known 
primitive 
societies
EOS
postmodernism
therefore
becomes 
a 
certain 
self-consciousness 
about 
a 
culture
's 
own 
historical 
relativity 
which 
begins 
to 
explain 
why
as 
its 
critics 
complain
it 
also 
involves 
the 
loss 
of 
the 
sense 
of 
an 
absoluteness 
of 
any 
western 
account 
of 
history
EOS
today
if 
we 
pose 
the 
difficult 
question 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
poststructuralism 
to 
postmodernism
one 
distinction 
between 
them 
that 
might 
be 
drawn 
would 
be 
that 
whereas 
postmodernism 
seems 
to 
include 
the 
problematic 
of 
the 
place 
of 
western 
culture 
in 
relation 
to 
non-western 
cultures
poststructuralism 
as 
a 
category 
seems 
not 
to 
imply 
such 
a 
perspective
EOS
this
however
is 
hardly 
the 
case
for 
it 
rather 
involves 
if 
anything 
a 
more 
active 
critique 
of 
the 
eurocentric 
premises 
of 
western 
knowledge
EOS
the 
difference 
would 
be 
that 
it 
does 
not 
offer 
a 
critique 
by 
positioning 
itself 
outside 
the 
west
but 
rather 
uses 
its 
own 
alterity 
and 
duplicity 
in 
order 
to 
effect 
its 
deconstruction
EOS
in 
this 
context
we 
may 
note
attempts 
to 
account 
for 
poststructuralism 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
aftermath 
of 
the 
events 
of 
may 
68 
seem 
positively 
myopic
lacking 
the 
very 
historical  
perspective 
to 
which 
they 
lay 
claim
EOS
contrary
then
to 
some 
of 
its 
more 
overreaching 
definitions
postmodernism 
itself 
could 
be 
said 
to 
mark 
not 
just 
the 
cultural 
effects 
of 
a 
new 
stage 
of 
late
capitalism
but 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
loss 
of 
european 
history 
and 
culture 
as 
history 
and 
culture
the 
loss 
of 
their 
unquestioned 
place 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
world
EOS
we 
could 
say 
that 
if
according 
to 
foucault
the 
centrality 
of 
man
dissolved 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
as 
the 
classical 
order
gave 
way 
to 
history
today 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century
as 
history
gives 
way 
to 
the 
postmodern
we 
are 
witnessing 
the 
dissolution 
of 
the 
west
EOS
marxism 
and 
the 
question 
of 
history
EOS
marxist 
literary 
criticism 
has 
not 
produced 
a 
new 
theory 
in 
over 
twenty 
years
EOS
not 
since 
macherey
's 
a 
theory 
of 
literary 
production 
of 
1966 
has 
there 
been 
any 
fundamental 
theoretical 
innovation
EOS
this 
date 
and 
this 
gap 
are 
by 
no 
means 
fortuitous
EOS
for 
much 
of 
this 
century 
marxist 
literary 
criticism 
monopolized 
the 
realm 
of 
literary 
theory
for 
the 
simple 
reason 
that 
only 
marxists 
consistently 
believed 
in 
its 
value 
and 
strategic 
necessity
EOS
2 
but 
since 
the 
rise 
of 
structuralism 
in 
the 
sixties 
marxist 
criticism 
has 
been 
more 
and 
more 
on 
the 
defensive
EOS
marxist 
humanists 
still 
often 
consider 
structuralism 
simply 
as 
an 
attack 
on 
marxism
this 
theory 
would 
be 
more 
persuasive 
if 
so 
many 
structuralists 
had 
not 
also 
been 
marxists
EOS
by 
contrast
it 
is 
certainly 
the 
case 
that
with 
certain 
notable 
exceptions
there 
are 
few 
marxist 
poststructuralists
EOS
if 
by 
the 
late 
seventies 
the 
intellectual 
arguments 
of 
poststructuralism 
began 
to 
seem 
virtually 
unanswerable
resistance 
eventually 
crystallized 
around 
the 
question 
of 
history
EOS
in 
its 
preoccupation 
with 
textuality
poststructuralism 
had 
apparently 
forgotten 
all 
about 
it
EOS
the 
earliest 
such 
critique 
in 
the 
field 
of 
literary 
theory 
was 
that 
of 
frank 
lentricchia
who 
organized 
his 
entire 
account 
of 
modern 
criticism 
around 
the 
premise 
of 
a 
repeated 
and 
extremely 
subtle 
denial 
of 
history 
by 
a 
variety 
of 
contemporary 
theorists
EOS
lentricchia
's 
argument 
was 
quickly 
endorsed 
by 
terry 
eagleton 
who 
claimed 
first 
that 
poststructuralism 
represented 
a 
hedonist 
withdrawal 
from 
history
aestheticism
and
a 
year 
later
that 
it 
amounted 
to 
a 
more 
menacing 
holocaust-like 
liquidation 
of 
history
EOS
moving 
beyond 
the 
confines 
of 
the 
literary
perry 
anderson 
has 
similarly 
dismissed 
all 
poststructuralism 
on 
the 
grounds 
that 
it 
represents 
the 
randomisation 
of 
history 
EOS
but 
what
we 
might 
pause 
to 
ask
is 
this 
remark 
supposed 
to 
suggest
EOS
is 
anderson 
using 
the 
word 
random
in 
its 
mathematical 
sense
as 
one 
out 
of 
a 
series
or 
in 
its 
statistical 
sense 
in 
which 
each 
item 
has 
an 
individual 
chance
EOS
it 
seems 
not
EOS
more 
likely 
he 
is 
using 
it 
in 
the 
more 
everyday 
usage 
of 
not 
sent 
or 
guided 
in 
any 
special 
direction
having 
no 
definite 
aim 
or 
purpose
oed
which 
suggests 
that 
any 
such 
view 
of 
history 
must 
have 
no 
end
and 
therefore 
no 
teleology
EOS
in 
other 
words
what  
we 
are 
really 
dealing 
with 
here 
is 
a 
defence 
of 
a 
belief 
in 
the 
rationality 
of 
the 
historical 
process
EOS
anderson
's 
history 
must 
work 
according 
to 
a 
rational 
principle
the 
dialectic
and 
be 
moving 
towards 
an 
end 
which 
will 
reveal 
and 
enact 
its 
meaning
EOS
without 
such 
a 
purpose
it 
is 
assumed
history 
must 
be 
meaningless
EOS
the 
terms 
of 
this 
argument 
repeat 
exactly 
those 
of 
the 
critical 
debate 
about 
univocal 
meaning
according 
to 
which 
the 
only 
alternative 
to 
the 
idea 
that 
history 
has 
a 
single 
meaning 
must 
be 
that 
it 
has 
none 
at 
all
EOS
but 
of 
course 
no 
one 
has 
really 
been 
suggesting 
that 
history 
has 
no 
meaning
for 
the 
obvious 
reason 
that 
any 
interpretation 
of 
history 
as 
such 
must 
ipso 
facto 
assert 
meaning
EOS
what 
is 
in 
dispute 
is 
whether 
history 
has 
a 
meaning 
as 
history
EOS
one 
alternative 
would 
be 
that 
history 
may 
be 
made 
up 
of 
the 
multiple 
meanings 
of 
specific
particular 
histories 
without 
their 
necessarily 
being 
in 
turn 
part 
of 
a 
larger 
meaning 
of 
an 
underlying 
idea 
or 
force
EOS
anderson
's 
accusation
which 
conflates 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
differential 
with 
the 
notion 
of 
the 
random
is 
therefore 
really 
directed 
against 
the 
possibility 
that 
different 
histories 
may 
have 
different 
meanings
EOS
but 
why 
deny 
that 
history 
can 
have 
multiple 
meanings
EOS
de 
facto 
it 
already 
has 
for 
even 
for 
a 
marxist 
who 
believes 
in 
the 
possibility 
of 
science
there 
exists 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
meanings 
of 
truth 
and 
of 
error
EOS
we 
are 
therefore 
not 
so 
much 
talking 
about 
a 
single 
meaning 
as 
a 
true 
one 
versus 
all 
the 
others 
which 
are 
false
EOS
in 
a 
similar 
way
even 
history
as 
a 
metahistorical 
category 
achieves 
its 
single 
meaning 
by 
subsuming 
a 
range 
of 
ethico-political 
concepts
such 
as
progress
human 
freedom
necessity
and 
the 
like
which 
then 
form 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
regulation 
and 
authorization 
of 
historical 
interpretation
EOS
this 
shifts 
the 
discussion 
away 
from 
any 
simple 
antithesis
EOS
the 
question 
about 
history 
then 
becomes 
the 
more 
interesting 
one 
of 
the 
relation 
between 
different 
significations
and 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
such 
differences 
can
or 
can
not
be 
articulated 
and 
unified 
under 
the 
same 
horizon 
of 
totalization 
to 
produce 
a 
single 
meaning
EOS
until 
the 
lonely 
hour 
arrives 
in 
which 
the 
philosophical 
proof 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
history 
is 
produced
then 
history 
will 
inevitably 
continue 
as 
a 
representation 
and 
interpretation 
of 
the 
past 
rather 
than 
marxist 
truth 
and 
the 
false 
or 
limited 
interpretation 
of 
all 
other 
historians
EOS
as 
a 
form 
of 
understanding 
history 
will 
necessarily 
also 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
whole 
range 
of 
questions 
that 
surround 
interpretation
representation 
and 
narrative 
in 
any 
form
EOS
this 
is 
the 
reason 
why 
in 
recent 
years 
theorists 
have 
turned 
their 
attention 
back 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
historicity 
of 
historical 
understanding
to 
its 
status 
as 
interpretation
representation 
or 
narrative
and
more 
radically
to 
the 
problem 
of 
temporality 
as 
such
EOS
lentricchia 
and 
eagleton
by 
contrast
invoke 
history 
rather 
like 
the 
political
an 
outside
a 
concrete
that 
somehow 
remains 
exterior 
to 
theory
unaffected 
by 
it
capable 
of 
enclosing 
it 
and 
even 
swallowing 
it 
up 
as 
if 
history 
were 
in 
a 
position 
to 
consume 
theory
EOS
history 
here 
is 
self-evident 
and 
needs 
no 
elaboration
EOS
we 
all 
know 
what 
it 
is 
apparently
EOS
but 
the  
problem 
with 
the 
idea 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
dismiss 
structuralism 
and 
poststructuralism 
with 
the 
charge 
that 
they 
neglect 
history 
is 
that 
this 
argument 
itself 
neglects 
history
EOS
for 
history
as 
althusser 
noted
has 
always 
been 
a 
problematical 
concept
EOS
any 
examination 
of 
the 
history 
of 
history
will 
demonstrate 
that 
it 
has 
never 
had 
the 
immediate 
certainty 
that 
is 
implied 
in 
the 
all 
too 
frequent 
invocation 
of
concrete 
history
EOS
far 
from 
being 
the 
concrete
it 
has 
always 
rather 
been 
the 
theoretical 
problem
EOS
to 
acknowledge 
that 
amounts 
to 
something 
very 
different 
from 
simply 
excising 
history 
as 
such
EOS
nevertheless 
the 
suggestion 
that 
structuralism 
and 
poststructuralism 
have 
denied 
history 
is 
a 
persuasive 
one 
which 
now 
has 
wide 
currency
EOS
such 
an 
argument
in 
implying 
that 
the 
problem 
is 
simply 
a 
question 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
history 
or 
of 
its 
presence
as 
if 
history 
were 
some 
undifferentiated 
entity 
that 
could 
just 
be 
added 
or 
taken 
away
stepped 
into 
or 
got 
out 
of
skates 
over 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
real 
question 
has 
always 
focused 
on 
the 
much 
more 
difficult 
issue 
of 
what 
kind 
of 
history
and 
of 
what 
status 
can 
be 
accorded 
to 
historical 
thought
EOS
the 
reproach 
that 
poststructuralism 
has 
neglected 
history 
really 
consists 
of 
the 
complaint 
that 
it 
has 
questioned 
history
EOS
this 
becomes 
clearer 
if 
it 
is 
considered 
from 
the 
more 
general 
perspective 
of 
post-modernism 
which 
has 
been 
widely 
characterized 
as 
involving 
a 
return 
of 
history
albeit 
as 
a 
category 
of 
representation
EOS
in 
fact 
it 
was 
rather 
modernism
as 
its 
name 
implies 
from 
latin 
modo 
just 
now
or 
hodie 
today
that 
tried 
to 
awake 
from 
the 
nightmare 
of 
history
self-consciously 
setting 
itself 
against 
the 
past
and 
rejecting 
forms 
of 
historical 
understanding

the 
argument 
against 
poststructuralism

the

according

a 
striving

represented 
for

for

by 
an

picture 
of 
classical 
greece
punctuated 
by 
the 
continual 
intrusion 
of 
a 
heterogeneous 
discontinuity
EOS
lukÃ¡cs 
argues 
that 
the 
novel 
can 
transcend 
this 
threat 
of 
dispersal 
through 
an 
assertion

a 
continuous 
temporality

this

ambivalent
EOS
the 
appearance

at 
the 
height

the

totalized

in 
the

a 
specially 
strong 
temptation

EOS
it 
comes

no 
surprise
for

to 
discover 
that 
the 
argument 
about 
poststructuralism 
neglecting 
history 
was 
initiated 
by 
those 
whose

intellectual

be 
identified

the 
existential 
marxist 
humanism

the

can 
really 
only 
succeed 
through 
a 
form 
of 
historical 
amnesia 
which 
conveniently 
forgets 
that

was 
almost 
impossible 
to 
find
EOS
any 
historical 
investigation 
will 
show 
that 
history 
has 
always 
been 
a 
problematic 
concept 
for

that 
has 
the 
status

this 
could

in 
the

here

history 
has

merleau-ponty 
accused 
the 
sartre 
of 
the 
communists

peace 
1952
of 
using 
an 
existentialist 
ontology 
to 
justify

as 
a 
completely 
voluntary 
effort

go 
beyond

destroy

EOS
sartre 
founds 
communist 
action 
precisely 
by 
refusing 
any 
productivity 
to 
history

by 
making 
history
insofar 
as 
it 
is 
intelligible
the 
immediate 
result

our 
volitions

as 
for 
the 
rest
it 
is 
an 
impenetrable 
opacity
EOS
through 
his 
extreme 
subjectivism
merleau-ponty 
argued
sartre 
avoided 
the 
traditional 
claims 
of 
marxism 
to 
be 
the 
realization 
of 
history 
and 
thus 
also 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
marxism 
to 
stalinism
EOS
with 
the 
growing 
recognition 
of 
the 
real 
nature 
of 
the 
stalinist 
regime
the 
ideological 
divisions 
of 
pre-war 
europe 
became 
too 
simplistic 
to 
sustain
and 
even 
the 
attentiste 
wait-and-see
attitude 
taken 
after 
the 
war 
by 
many 
marxists
including 
merleau-ponty 
himself 
in 
humanism 
and 
terror 
1947
became 
no 
longer 
tenable
EOS
stalinism 
posed 
a 
crisis 
for 
marxism 
from 
which 
it 
could
in 
a 
sense
be 
said 
never 
to 
have 
recovered
the 
conundrum 
being 
that 
if 
marxism 
is 
true
as 
it 
claims 
that 
it 
is
how 
did 
the 
first 
marxist 
state 
end 
up 
as 
stalinist
EOS
there 
are 
basically 
two 
positions 
that 
can 
be 
taken 
with 
respect 
to 
this 
irrevocable 
split 
between 
theory 
and 
practice
either 
marxism 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
not 
true
or 
the 
marxism 
of 
stalinist 
russia 
was 
not 
proper 
marxism
EOS
the 
second 
alternative 
poses 
a 
serious 
problem
however
insofar 
as 
it 
leads 
to 
the 
further 
question
how 
could 
such 
marxism 
not 
be 
true 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
how 
could 
history
in 
the 
objective 
processes 
on 
which 
a 
scientific 
marxism 
places 
so 
much 
faith
be 
undialectical 
enough 
to 
produce 
stalinism 
from 
the 
october 
revolution
EOS
how 
could 
history 
have 
failed 
to 
bring 
about 
an 
end 
to 
history
EOS
merleau-ponty
's 
response 
was 
to 
argue 
that 
history 
itself 
had 
shown 
marxist 
philosophy 
to 
have 
been 
flawed
such 
philosophy 
must 
therefore 
give 
up 
its 
claim 
to 
truth
EOS
ironically
then
the 
trajectory 
which 
today 
produces 
the 
marxist 
argument 
that 
poststructuralism 
neglects 
history 
was 
itself 
initiated 
by 
the 
claim 
that 
marxism 
itself 
had 
been 
invalidated 
by 
history
EOS
in 
this 
context
the 
major 
challenge 
for 
marxism 
became 
how 
to 
explain 
marxism
's 
detour
from 
itself
a 
question 
on 
which 
sartre

project 
was 
to 
founder 
in 
the 
second 
volume 
of 
the 
critique 
of 
dialectical 
reason 
EOS
it 
was 
stalin
's 
unfortunate 
deviation 
which 
led

the 
whole

european 
marxists 
to 
return-to-marx

major 
examples

and 
althusser

in 
germany

on 
the 
other 
hand
arguing 
that 
only 
one

could 
be 
said 
to 
be 
the

rejected

trying 
to 
define 
a 
new
more 
genuine 
marxism 
as 
the 
return-to-marxists 
tried 
to 
do
EOS
according 
to 
merleau-ponty
western 
academic 
marxism
starting 
with 
lukÃ¡cs
amounted 
only 
to 
the 
production 
of 
ideas 
without 
historical 
equivalents
204
EOS
he 
therefore 
repudiated 
any 
attempt 
to 
begin 
the 
painful 
separation 
of 
an 
authentic
from 
a 
false
orthodox 
or 
official 
marxism
choosing 
rather 
to 
stress 
the 
ambivalence 
of 
marxism 
itself
EOS
for 
merleau-ponty 
no 
sublation 
could 
resolve 
marxism 
s 
own 
division 
between 
its 
theory 
and 
the 
history 
of 
its 
practice
itself
he 
argued
an 
acting 
out 
of 
its 
theoretical 
equivocation 
between 
history 
as 
a 
process 
of 
natural 
necessity 
and 
history 
as 
the 
product 
of 
human 
praxis
EOS
these 
conflicts
he 
contended
although 
highlighted 
in 
the 
differences 
between 
the 
western 
marxism 
of 
lukÃ¡cs 
and 
the 
orthodoxy 
of 
marxist-leninism
could 
be 
traced 
back 
to 
the 
work 
of 
marx 
himself
EOS
merleau-ponty
's 
argument 
thus 
meant 
acknowledging 
a 
certain 
equivocalness 
in 
marxist 
claims 
to 
truth
which 
could 
no 
longer 
claim 
exemption 
from 
critical 
examination
and 
led 
inevitably
therefore
to 
an 
early 
form 
of 
what
even 
then
was 
characterized 
as 
post-marxism
EOS
merleau-ponty
whose 
anticipations 
of 
later 
post-marxists 
such 
as 
foucault 
and 
lyotard 
are 
readily 
apparent
therefore 
rejected 
not 
the 
dialectic 
as 
such
nor 
history
but 
the 
closed 
dialectic 
as 
an 
autonomous 
principle 
that 
was 
supposed 
to 
produce 
the 
grand 
narrative 
of 
history
EOS
the 
illusion 
was 
only 
to 
precipitate 
into 
a 
historical 
fact 
the 
proletariat
's 
birth 
and 
growth 
history
's 
total 
meaning
to 
believe 
that

itself

in 
a 
provocative 
comparison

the 
failures

french

he 
argued 
that 
the

from

fact 
that 
no

to

instead
merleau-ponty 
proposed 
an

concede

give 
up 
the

or 
to 
put 
it 
another

maintained

can 
only 
constitute

jean-paul 
sartre
EOS
sartre 
took 
the 
opposite 
course 
to 
merleau-ponty 
and 
sought 
instead 
to 
define 
a 
new 
authentic 
marxism
EOS
his 
project 
in 
the 
critique 
of 
dialectical 
reason 
1960
amounted 
to 
a 
philosophical 
defence 
of 
marxism 
and 
its 
dialectic 
through 
a 
reassertion 
of 
its 
claim 
to 
be 
the 
only 
valid 
interpretation 
of 
history
the 
untranscendable 
philosophy 
for 
our 
time
EOS
however
sartre 
was 
no 
more 
prepared 
than 
merleau-ponty 
to 
return 
to 
what 
he 
characterized 
as 
marxist 
organicism
in 
which 
the 
laws 
of 
history 
unfold 
according 
to 
their 
own 
autonomous 
momentum
EOS
not 
wishing 
to 
propose 
history 
as 
a 
transcendent 
law 
outside 
the 
human
sartre 
was 
careful 
to 
distinguish 
his 
claims 
from 
engels
' 
validation 
of 
the 
dialectic 
as 
the 
law 
of 
nature
EOS
he 
sought 
instead 
to 
prove 
that 
history 
achieves 
its 
course 
and 
its 
meaning 
from 
the 
actions 
of 
men
even 
if 
men 
are 
also 
simultaneously 
the 
products 
of 
history
EOS
merleau-ponty 
had 
accused 
the 
existentialist 
sartre 
of 
denying 
history 
and 
trying 
to 
hold 
everything 
together 
instead 
only 
by 
the 
hopeless 
heroism 
of 
the 
i
EOS
sartre 
therefore 
tried 
to 
show 
that 
the 
two 
were 
not 
opposed
arguing 
that 
the 
dialectic 
is 
produced 
by 
human 
subjectivity 
rather 
than 
inscribed 
within 
history 
itself
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
also 
asserted 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
marxist 
account 
of 
there 
being 
one 
history 
with 
a 
single 
meaning 
a 
history
that 
is
in 
which 
all 
differences 
return 
as 
the 
same
EOS
everything
therefore
hinged 
on 
sartre
's 
ability 
to 
substantiate 
the 
inter-dependence 
of 
these 
two 
claims
EOS
there 
is 
a 
crisis 
in 
marxism
sartre 
announced 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
critique 
this 
crisis
not 
the 
first 
and 
not 
to 
be 
the 
last
sartre 
characterized 
as 
the 
result 
of 
a 
paradox 
in 
which 
historical 
materialism 
had 
become 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
time
the 
only 
truth 
of 
history 
and 
a 
total 
indetermination 
of 
the 
truth
i
19
EOS
today 
we 
might 
say 
that 
it 
had 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
different 
from 
itself
EOS
this 
was 
the 
aporia 
detected 
by 
merleau-ponty
but 
rather 
than 
question 
marxism
's 
truth
sartre 
sought 
to 
remove 
its 
indetermination
EOS
he  
argued 
that 
though 
historical 
materialism 
had 
satisfactorily 
explained 
the 
forms 
and 
conditions 
of 
human 
reality 
it 
had 
never 
established 
theoretically 
the 
validity 
of 
its 
own 
existence
never 
shown 
how 
it 
constituted 
not 
just 
the 
substance 
of 
reality 
but 
its 
logical 
form 
as 
well
EOS
in 
order 
to 
prove 
the 
truth 
of 
history
's 
prospective 
totalization 
into 
one 
meaning
therefore
sartre
's 
initial 
philosophical 
task 
was 
to 
ground 
his 
argument 
epistemologically 
by 
proving 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
the 
dialectic 
itself
thus 
demonstrating 
not 
only 
that 
history 
was 
dialectically 
intelligible 
but 
also 
why 
it 
necessarily 
should 
be 
so
EOS
the 
dialectic
according 
to 
sartre
is 
both 
a 
method 
and 
a 
movement 
in 
the 
object
i
20
marxism 
asserts 
simultaneously 
that 
both 
the 
process 
of 
knowledge 
and 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
real 
are 
dialectical
but 
it 
has 
never 
proved 
the 
former 
basing 
its 
claim 
to 
truth 
instead 
on 
the 
dogmatic 
dialectic
of 
natural 
science
EOS
accordingly
much 
of 
volume 
i 
of 
the 
critique 
is 
taken 
up 
with 
the 
attempt 
to 
prove 
the 
dialectic 
a 
priori 
as 
the 
universal 
method 
and 
the 
law 
of 
anthropology
superseding 
that 
which 
kant 
had 
provided 
for 
analytical 
reason
EOS
volume 
two
sartre 
announces
will 
then 
prove 
the 
truth 
of 
history 
i
52
EOS
it 
will 
attempt 
to 
establish 
that 
there 
is 
one 
human 
history
with 
one 
truth 
and 
one 
intelligibility 
not 
by 
considering 
the 
material 
content 
of 
this 
history
but 
by 
demonstrating 
that 
a 
practical 
multiplicity
whatever 
it 
may 
be
must 
unceasingly 
totalise 
itself 
through 
interiorizing 
its 
multiplicity 
at 
all 
levels
EOS
i
69
EOS
the 
point
therefore
is 
to 
validate 
marxism
to 
show 
that 
it 
is 
not 
simply 
a 
method 
of 
interpretation
nor 
even 
that 
it 
is 
the 
best 
method 
of 
interpretation 
that 
can 
most 
successfully 
account 
for 
the 
facts 
and 
the 
course 
of 
history
but 
to 
prove 
a 
priori 
that 
history 
works 
according 
to 
dialectical 
structures
and 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
moments 
of 
their 
inter-relations
the 
ever 
vaster 
and 
more 
complex 
movement 
which 
totalises 
them 
and
finally
the 
very 
direction 
of 
the 
totalization
that 
is 
to 
say
the 
meaning 
of 
history
and 
its 
truth
i
69
EOS
had 
he 
succeeded
sartre 
would 
have 
established 
dialectical 
reason 
as 
successfully 
for 
the 
human 
sciences 
as 
kant 
had 
established 
analytical 
reason 
for 
natural 
science
EOS
but 
he 
was 
unable 
to 
do 
it
EOS
the 
indetermination 
that 
he 
sought 
to 
banish 
increasingly 
returned 
to 
haunt 
him
he 
could 
never 
demonstrate 
how 
the 
unceasing 
totalization 
of 
multiplicity 
would 
ever 
reach 
its 
promised 
moment 
of 
finality
EOS
sartre
's 
claim 
for 
the 
continued 
validity 
of 
marxism 
as 
a 
method 
of 
understanding 
necessarily 
meant 
that 
he 
had 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
stalinism
EOS
his 
was 
the 
first 
attempt 
to 
explain 
stalinism 
as 
an 
aberration 
through 
the 
forms 
of 
marxist 
analysis 
itself
EOS
rather 
than 
reject 
marxism 
on 
the 
grounds 
that 
it 
had 
been 
disproved 
by 
history
as 
merleau-ponty 
had 
done
he 
sought 
to 
account 
for 
stalinism 
through 
a 
dialectical 
analysis 
of 
the 
specific 
history 
of 
the 
soviet 
union 
since 
the 
revolution
theory 
and 
practice
he 
argued
had 
become 
separated 
with 
the 
result 
that 
the 
former  
had 
become 
sclerosed
while 
the 
latter 
had 
become 
blind
and 
unprincipled
i
50
EOS
according 
to 
sartre
if 
the 
dialectic 
had 
become 
blocked
an 
understanding 
of 
its 
detour 
could 
nevertheless 
only 
be 
achieved 
through 
the 
use 
of 
a 
dialectical 
logic
EOS
he 
therefore 
sought 
to 
prove 
both 
that 
the 
structures 
of 
history 
were 
necessarily 
dialectical 
and 
that 
the 
course 
of 
actual 
history 
could 
be 
shown 
to 
be 
so
EOS
but 
in 
attempting 
to 
discover 
why 
the 
russian 
revolution 
followed 
the 
path 
it 
did
he 
found 
himself 
arriving 
at 
the 
conclusion 
that
far 
from 
being 
a 
false
deviation
in 
the 
circumstances 
of 
history 
stalinism 
had 
been 
necessary
EOS
having 
set 
out 
to 
demonstrate 
how
through 
its 
understanding 
of 
the 
structure 
of 
history
marxism 
was 
in 
a 
position 
to 
forecast 
the 
future
he 
came 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
there 
was 
no 
guarantee 
that 
history 
could 
promise 
anything 
better 
that 
what 
had 
just 
passed

the 
first

EOS
unity 
had 
been 
easy 
during 
the 
resistance
because 
relationships 
were 
almost 
always 
man-to-man
EOS
over 
against 
the 
german 
army 
or 
the 
vichy 
government
where 
social 
generality 
ruled
as 
it 
does 
in 
all 
machines 
of 
state
the 
resistance 
offered 
the 
rare 
phenomenon 
of 
historical 
action 
which 
remained 
personal
EOS
the 
psychological 
and 
moral 
elements 
of 
political 
action 
were 
almost 
the 
only 
ones 
to 
appear 
here
which 
is 
why 
intellectuals 
least 
inclined 
to 
politics 
were 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
resistance
EOS
the 
resistance 
was 
a 
unique 
experience 
for 
them
and 
they 
wanted 
to 
preserve 
its 
experience 
in 
the 
new 
french 
politics 
because 
this 
experience 
broke 
away 
from 
the 
famous 
dilemma 
of 
being 
and 
doing
which 
confronts 
all 
intellectuals 
in 
the 
face 
of 
action
EOS
it 
is 
only 
too 
obvious 
that 
this 
balance 
between 
action 
and 
personal 
life 
was 
intimately 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
conditions 
of 
clandestine 
action 
and 
could 
not 
survive 
it
EOS
and 
in 
this 
sense 
it 
must 
be 
said 
that 
the 
resistance 
experience
by 
making 
us 
believe 
that 
politics 
is 
a 
relationship 
between 
man 
and 
man 
or 
between 
consciousnesses
fostered 
our 
illusions 
of 
1939 
and 
masked 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
incredible 
power 
of 
history 
which 
the 
occupation 
taught 
us 
in 
another 
connection
EOS
if 
by 
1945 
merleau-ponty 
had 
here 
already 
indicated 
the 
historical 
basis 
for 
what 
was 
to 
become 
sartre
's 
project 
in 
the 
critique 
the 
theoretical 
problem 
that 
followed 
was 
how 
to 
unite 
orthodox 
marxist 
concepts 
of 
economic 
determinism 
and 
historical 
necessity 
with 
the 
individualism 
of 
sartre
's 
earlier 
work
that 
is 
the 
existentialist 
notion 
of 
the 
authentic 
self 
and 
the 
possibility 
of 
choosing 
one
's 
own 
freedom
how 
to 
relocate 
human 
practice 
within 
historical 
determinism
to 
reconcile 
the 
individual 
with 
the 
social
the 
idea 
of 
agency 
with 
that 
of 
necessity
or 
freedom 
with 
history
EOS
for 
marxist 
or 
hegelian 
thought
such 
an 
age-old 
contradiction 
ought 
to 
be 
resolvable 
through 
the 
operations 
of 
dialectical 
logic
EOS
citing 
marx
's 
famous 
remark 
in  
the 
eighteenth 
brumaire 
men 
make 
their 
own 
history
but 
under 
circumstances
given 
and 
transmitted 
from 
the 
past
sartre 
suggested 
that 
this 
implied 
the 
permanent 
and 
dialectical 
unity 
of 
freedom 
and 
necessity
i

EOS
accordingly
he 
attempted 
to 
shift 
marxism 
away 
from 
orthodox 
theories 
of 
an 
absolute 
determinism 
towards 
the 
primacy 
of 
a 
concept 
of 
history
which
while 
still 
a 
totality 
as 
it 
had 
been 
for 
lukÃ¡cs
a 
process 
with 
a 
determinate 
meaning 
and 
end
could 
also 
include 
a 
concept 
of 
human 
agency 
and 
thus 
articulate 
the 
individual 
with 
the 
social
freedom 
with 
determinism
EOS
today
sartre
's 
voluntarism 
is 
to 
some 
extent 
returning 
to 
favour 
as 
the 
result 
of 
a 
desire 
to 
retrieve 
the 
categories 
of 
agency 
and 
the 
subject
which 
goes 
together 
with 
the 
wish 
to 
get 
out 
of 
the 
apparently 
totalizing 
systems 
of 
adorno
althusser 
or 
foucault
EOS
sartre
's 
stress 
on 
the 
role 
of 
the 
subject 
also 
finds 
approval 
because 
many 
of 
those 
no 
longer 
prepared 
to 
argue 
for 
a 
general 
theory 
of 
history 
as 
the 
progress 
of 
a 
single 
narrative 
of 
class-struggle
have 
begun 
to 
argue 
instead 
for 
a 
return 
of 
its 
correlative
the 
subject
almost 
as 
if 
it 
was 
the 
next 
best 
thing 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
history 
itself
EOS
but 
it 
still 
leaves 
us 
with 
the 
crucial 
problem 
that 
sartre 
had 
to 
solve
namely 
how 
to 
link 
human 
consciousness 
with 
the 
processes 
of 
history 
so 
that 
the 
former 
can 
be 
said 
to 
be 
the 
agent 
of 
the 
latter
EOS
how 
could 
this 
take 
place
EOS
as 
sartre 
had 
put 
it 
in 
what 
is 
literature 
EOS
never 
has 
homo 
faber 
better 
understood 
that 
he 
has 
made 
history 
and 
never 
has 
he 
felt 
so 
powerless 
before 
history
EOS
how 
can 
man 
make 
history 
if 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
is 
history 
which 
makes 
him
EOS
sartre 
considered 
that 
orthodox 
dialectical 
materialism 
takes 
the 
easy 
way 
out 
by 
merely 
eliminating 
the 
first 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
second
making 
man 
a 
passive 
product 
entirely 
determined 
by 
economic 
circumstances
EOS
unwilling 
to 
follow 
merleau-ponty 
by 
dropping 
the 
second 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
first
sartre 
argued 
that 
it 
was 
possible 
for 
man 
to 
be 
both 
at 
once 
through 
the 
movement 
of 
praxis 
that 
is 
intentional 
actions 
which 
produce 
material 
effects
EOS
its 
corollary
whereby 
praxis 
becomes 
determining 
history
he 
called 
the 
practico-inert
by 
which 
he 
meant 
the 
material 
circumstances 
that 
have 
themselves 
been 
created 
by 
previous 
praxes 
and 
which 
form 
the 
conditions 
for 
new 
praxis
EOS
the 
individual 
is 
thus 
both 
totalizer 
and 
totalized
deftly 
uniting 
freedom 
with 
necessity
EOS
though 
this 
neatly 
solves 
the 
problem 
of 
how 
man 
can 
make 
history 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
history 
makes 
him
it 
does 
not 
answer 
the 
larger 
question 
of 
how 
a 
multiplicity 
of 
the 
products 
of 
individual 
acts
totalizations
can 
themselves 
be 
totalized 
into 
the 
overall 
totalization 
required 
by 
the 
logic 
of 
dialectical 
rationality

than 
being 
the 
arbitrary
blind 
and 
self-cancelling

does 
not 
in 
itself 
answer 
what 
ronald 
aronson 
has 
rightly 
characterized 
as 
the 
question 
for 
sartre
how 
do 
separate
antagonistic 
actions 
yield 
a 
history
how 
do 
individual 
totalizations 
lead 
to 
totalization 
and 
also 
progress
the 
direction 
of 
history
its 
truth 
and 
its 
meaning
EOS
for 
the 
whole 
basis 
of 
sartre
's 
argument 
is 
that 
the 
dialectic 
of 
history 
is 
not 
a 
metaphysical 
law
some 
powerful 
unitary

each

what 
sartre 
needs 
to 
demonstrate
therefore
is 
that 
if 
the

of 
the

works 
from 
the 
individual 
level
overall 
it 
produces 
nothing

than 
the

the 
meaning 
of

as 
such
EOS
the 
dialectic 
is 
the 
law 
of 
totalization 
which 
creates 
several 
collectivities
several 
societies

that 
is

at 
the

it 
must 
be 
woven 
out 
of

of 
individual

EOS
we 
must 
show 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
it 
to 
be 
both 
a 
resultant 
and 
a 
totalizing

it

what

the

of

how 
does 
it 
continually 
bring

the 
unity 
of

profusion 
and

EOS
sartre 
does 
not 
attempt 
to 
answer 
this 
question
shifting 
rather 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
lack 
of 
self-consciousness
EOS
the 
dialectic 
is 
the 
law 
that 
remains 
hidden
EOS
at 
the 
moment
history 
is 
made 
without 
being 
known 
l'histoire 
se

history 
constitutes
we 
might 
say 
today
a 
political 
unconscious
EOS
marxism
on 
the 
other 
hand
sartre 
claims
is 
history 
itself 
becoming 
conscious 
of 
itself
i
40
as 
for 
lukÃ¡cs
it 
is 
by 
becoming 
conscious 
of 
itself 
as 
the 
subject 
of 
history 
that 
the 
working 
class 
will 
understand 
history
's 
meaning 
and 
so 
recognize 
itself 
as 
the 
meaning 
of 
history
EOS
while 
he 
suggests 
in 
apocalyptic 
tones 
in 
the 
problem 
of 
method 
that 
this 
process 
of 
self-consciousness 
is 
at 
last 
beginning 
to 
take 
place
and 
that 
civil
foreign 
and 
colonial 
wars 
are 
becoming 
apparent 
as 
different 
forms 
of 
a 
single 
class 
struggle
sartre 
also 
admits 
that 
the 
divorce 
between 
theory 
and 
praxis 
which 
ensued 
under 
stalinism 
has 
generally 
prevented 
any 
clear 
self-consciousness 
among 
the 
masses
EOS
the 
detour
of 
stalinism 
is 
thus 
formalized 
as 
marxism
's 
own 
descent 
into 
its 
unconscious
resulting 
in 
a 
dream-work 
of 
heterogeneous 
histories 
that 
have 
eluded 
systematization 
and 
subsumption 
into 
the 
single 
meaning 
of 
marxism
's 
own 
reading 
of 
history
EOS
it 
is 
therefore
sartre 
argues
our 
historical 
task 
to 
make 
it 
known
promoting 
not 
just 
the 
historical 
process 
as 
such
but 
also 
the 
general 
recognition 
whereby 
the 
plurality 
of 
the 
meanings 
of 
individual 
histories 
can 
be 
seen 
to 
combine 
to 
make 
one 
history
with 
one 
meaning 
the 
truth 
of 
humanity
i
822
EOS
sartre
's 
account 
thus 
sets 
up 
the 
articulation 
of 
history
univocal 
meaning
and 
totality 
as 
the 
indissoluble 
set 
of 
elements 
required 
for 
the 
validation 
of 
marxism
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
save 
it 
from 
its 
detour  
from 
itself
EOS
the 
problem
however
remains 
how 
such 
universals 
are 
produced 
from 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
initiating 
individual 
praxes
EOS
if 
history 
is 
a 
history 
of 
conflict
how 
could 
it 
be 
both 
one 
and 
internally 
diversified 
without 
the 
inner 
moving 
principle 
of 
the 
dialectic
EOS
how 
can 
history 
be 
a 
unity 
if 
it 
is 
also 
conflictual
if 
each 
action 
is 
aimed 
at 
destroying 
the 
other 
and 
results 
in 
a 
double 
negation 
in 
which 
the 
original 
aims 
of 
each 
action 
have 
been 
destroyed 
by 
the 
other
EOS
if 
each 
action 
negates 
the 
aim 
of 
the 
other
where 
is 
the 
unity
totalized 
in 
the 
conflict

how 
does 
history 
constantly 
totalize 
itself

sartre 
arrives 
at 
what 
he 
calls 
the 
real 
problem 
of 
history
that 
is 
how 
there 
can 
be 
totalization 
without 
a 
totalizer
only 
at 
the 
very 
end 
of 
volume 
i. 
it 
is 
not 
until 
the 
next

however
that 
he 
intends 
to 
show 
how 
individual 
actions
separate 
multiplicities
make 
up 
one 
human 
history
with 
one 
truth 
and 
one 
intelligibility
i
69
EOS
throughout
sartre 
has 
nevertheless 
taken 
it 
for 
granted 
that 
such 
a 
totalisation 
is 
constantly 
developing 
both 
as 
history 
and 
as 
historical 
truth
i
822
EOS
his 
history
therefore
is 
always 
in 
process
but 
its 
teleology 
of 
a 
final 
totalization 
always 
has 
to 
be 
assumed
EOS
he 
thus 
asserts 
the 
truth 
of 
history 
while 
constantly 
projecting 
forwards 
and 
deferring 
its 
proof
EOS
but 
when 
the 
proof 
comes 
it 
also 
turns 
out 
to 
rest 
on 
the 
assumption

it 
is 
already 
true

the 
second 
critique 
EOS
we 
are 
trying 
to 
establish 
the 
truth 
of

EOS
sartre 
produces 
a 
persuasive 
formulation 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
individual 
to 
the 
determining 
historical 
circumstance 
through 
his 
concepts 
of 
praxis 
and 
the 
practico-inert
it 
is 
also 
obvious 
to 
him 
how 
the 
larger 
question 
of 
history 
ought 
to 
be 
solved
EOS
he 
asserts 
it 
often 
enough
history 
continually 
effects 
totalisations 
of 
totalisations
i
15
EOS
but 
in 
volume 
i 
of 
the 
critique 
as 
we 
have 
seen
he 
continually 
defers 
the 
demonstration 
of 
his 
proof
EOS
for 
the 
dogmatic 
dialectic
as 
he 
describes 
dialectical 
materialism
the 
whole 
question 
naturally 
poses 
no 
problem
for 
each 
person 
or 
group 
simply 
constitutes 
a 
partial 
moment 
of 
an 
already 
operative 
movement 
of 
totalization 
that 
produces 
them 
and 
then 
goes 
beyond 
them
EOS
but 
sartre
's 
dispensing 
with 
all 
historicist 
schemas 
creates 
the 
problem 
of 
how
between 
two 
autonomous 
and 
contradictory 
totalizations
there 
could 
be 
one 
dialectical 
intelligibility 
of 
the 
ongoing 
process
ii
13
EOS
he 
attempts 
to 
solve 
this 
through 
matching 
his 
account 
of 
contradiction 
with 
a 
new 
concept 
derived 
from 
the 
conjunction 
of 
work 
and 
labour
anti-labour
anti-travail 
a 
category 
of 
negation
EOS
the 
products 
of 
a 
conflict
as 
well 
as 
its 
residues
may 
seem 
incomprehensible 
insofar 
as 
they 
differ 
from 
the 
original 
intentions 
of 
any 
of 
the 
combatants
EOS
nevertheless 
they 
constitute 
the 
basis 
and 
conditions 
for 
further 
actions 
and 
history
EOS
dialectical 
reason 
encounters 
such 
products 
as 
undecidables
EOS
aporias 
because 
they 
seem 
to 
be 
at 
once 
the 
results 
of 
a 
communal 
enterprise 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
bearing 
witness 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
enterprise 
never 
existed 
except 
as 
the 
inhuman 
reverse 
side 
of 
two 
opposed 
actions 
in 
which 
each 
aims 
to 
destroy 
the 
other
EOS
in 
the 
dialectical 
perspective
we 
encounter 
these 
objects 
as 
productions 
which 
are 
human 
and 
provided 
with 
a 
future
thus 
they 
seem 
by 
themselves 
to 
be 
totalizations 
in 
process
EOS
ii
20
EOS
this 
means 
that 
first
they 
lead 
to 
unforeseeable 
results
and 
second
that 
the 
internal 
structure 
of 
social 
objects 
contains 
the 
double 
negation 
of 
themselves 
and 
of 
each 
constituent 
part 
by 
the 
other
ii
22
EOS
there 
is
therefore
before 
any 
understanding 
of 
historic 
agents 
and 
movements
a 
certain 
aporia 
in 
all 
social 
ensembles
from 
afar 
they 
may 
appear 
whole
but 
close 
to
they 
can 
be 
seen 
as 
riddled 
with 
holes
EOS
this 
increasingly 
comes 
to 
resemble 
nothing 
so 
much 
as 
sartre
's 
own 
account 
of 
history
EOS
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
negativity 
of 
this 
formulation
sartre 
is 
obliged 
to 
pose 
once 
again 
the 
problem 
of 
whether 
there 
can 
be 
a 
totalization
without 
any 
independent 
totalizer 
or 
totalizing 
force 
such 
as 
the 
dialectic
or 
whether 
the 
structure 
of 
negation 
that 
he 
has 
described 
means 
that
as 
for 
adorno 
or 
bakhtin
history 
does 
not 
develop 
positively 
but
rather
negatively
and 
is 
therefore 
instead 
detotalizing
EOS
marxism 
is 
rigorously 
true 
if 
history 
is 
totalization
it 
is 
not 
so 
any 
more 
if 
human 
history 
decomposes 
into 
a 
plurality 
of 
particular 
histories
or 
if
in 
any 
case
within 
the 
relationship 
of 
immanence 
that 
characterizes 
struggle
the 
negation 
of 
each 
adversary 
by 
the 
other 
is 
on 
principle 
detotalizing 
EOS
certainly
we 
have 
neither 
the 
design 
nor 
the 
actual 
possibility 
of 
showing 
here 
the 
full 
truth 
of 
dialectical 
materialism
EOS
our 
goal 
is 
solely 
to 
establish 
whether
in 
a 
practical 
ensemble 
torn 
apart 
by 
antagonism 
whether 
there 
are 
multiple 
conflicts 
or 
whether 
they 
are 
reduced 
to 
one
the 
breaks 
themselves 
are 
totalizing 
and 
carried 
along 
by 
the 
totalizing 
movement 
of 
the 
ensemble
EOS
ii
25
EOS
at 
this 
point 
sartre 
confronts 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
whole 
project 
of 
the 
critique 
stated 
so 
confidently 
on 
its 
very 
first 
page 
it 
must 
be 
proved 
that 
a 
negation 
of 
a 
negation 
can 
be 
an 
affirmation
i
15
may 
break 
down
EOS
perhaps 
the 
truth 
of 
history 
can
not 
be 
proved
its 
direction 
can
not 
be 
discerned
EOS
sartre
's 
reaction 
to 
the 
threat 
that 
the 
negation 
of 
a 
negation 
may 
produce 
a 
detotalizing 
effect 
is 
to 
introduce 
a 
new 
category
a 
unifying 
force 
of 
a 
singularization
which 
incarnates 
the 
universal
if 
totalization 
really 
is 
an 
ongoing 
process
he 
writes
then 
it 
operates 
everywhere
EOS
that 
means 
both 
that 
there 
is 
a 
dialectical 
meaning 
of 
the 
practical 
ensemble
and 
that 
each 
singular 
event 
totalizes 
in 
itself 
the 
practical 
ensemble 
in 
the 
infinite 
richness 
of 
its 
singularity
ii
26
EOS
unlike 
lukÃ¡cs
' 
insignificant 
event 
from 
which 
the  
universal 
is 
precariously 
drawn 
out 
through 
the 
narrative
sartre
's 
singularity 
works 
synecdochally 
in 
a 
conventional 
antinomy 
with 
the 
universal
the 
relation 
between 
the 
two 
structured 
according 
to 
the 
familiar 
nineteenth-century 
model 
of 
organic 
growth 
or 
process 
in 
which 
each 
singular 
event 
makes 
up 
the 
whole 
while
as 
he 
puts 
it
the 
whole 
is 
entirely 
present 
in 
the 
part 
as 
its 
present 
meaning 
and 
as 
its 
destiny
EOS
sartre
's 
singular 
universal
therefore
begs 
the 
question
for 
it 
is 
predicated 
on 
the 
assumption 
that
if 
there 
is 
not 
a 
totality 
as 
such
then 
there 
already 
is 
an 
overall 
totalization
if 
totalization 
really 
is 
an 
ongoing 
process
EOS
that 
developing 
process 
is 
itself 
totalized 
through 
sartre
's 
assertion 
that 
each 
totalization 
is 
the 
totalization 
of 
all 
struggles
as 
it 
must 
be 
if 
the 
singular 
is 
to 
incarnate 
the 
universal
EOS
the 
concept 
of 
the 
singular 
universal 
thus 
facilitates 
a 
circularity 
in 
the 
argument 
whereby 
sartre 
can 
avoid 
the 
question 
which 
he 
began 
by 
posing
EOS
so 
the 
singular 
universal 
presumes 
the 
totalization 
he 
ca
n't 
yet
prove
EOS
this 
strategy 
marks 
a 
structure 
of 
repetition 
in 
sartre
's 
text
each 
time 
he 
poses 
the 
question 
of 
how 
there 
can 
be 
totalization 
of 
history 
without 
a 
totalizer
he 
retreats 
to 
a 
more 
limited 
example 
whose 
unity 
is 
already 
evident
but 
which 
in 
the 
end 
only 
brings 
him 
back 
to 
the 
original 
question 
again
EOS
in 
this 
case 
sartre 
demonstrates 
how 
the 
singular 
universal 
works
by 
appealing 
to 
the 
concrete 
example 
of 
a 
boxing 
match 
a 
random 
exemplification 
that 
just 
happens 
to 
reproduce 
the 
single 
adversaries 
of 
the 
master/slave 
dialectic
EOS
its 
totalization 
takes 
place 
through 
its 
incarnation
as 
part 
of 
the 
totality 
of 
boxing
in 
the 
overall 
framework 
within 
which 
each 
individual 
fight 
occurs
EOS
each 
boxing 
match
sartre 
claims
must 
be 
both 
a 
unique 
event 
and 
also 
in 
some 
sense 
the 
incarnation 
of 
all 
boxing
whose 
rules 
and 
conventions 
it 
follows
and 
whose 
past 
and 
future 
history 
it 
sets 
itself 
against
EOS
but 
it 
is 
also 
apparent 
that 
that 
totality 
is 
not 
completely 
known
nor 
is 
its 
future 
shape 
even 
presumed
EOS
by 
totalization
therefore
sartre 
does 
not 
here 
mean 
anything 
like 
a 
predetermined 
end 
or 
final 
closure 
of 
a 
totality 
but 
rather 
a 
process 
of 
mediation 
among 
the 
parts
where 
each 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
other
EOS
no 
one 
can 
predict 
the 
future 
of 
boxing
either 
at 
the 
level 
of 
particular 
victories 
or 
defeats
in 
effect 
a 
structure 
of 
repetition
nor 
at 
the 
more 
general 
level 
of 
possible 
modifications 
or 
developments 
of 
the 
sport
EOS
yet 
each 
individual 
bout 
articulates 
itself 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
history 
of 
boxing
known 
and 
unknown
EOS
this 
allows 
sartre 
to 
include 
chance 
and 
contingency 
in 
his 
scheme
EOS
since 
it 
can
not 
be 
known 
as 
a 
concept 
that 
will 
realize 
itself 
in 
the 
future
sartre 
argues 
instead 
that 
the 
totality 
only 
produces 
itself 
in 
the 
moment
the 
incarnation 
as 
such 
is 
at 
once 
unrealizable 
except 
as 
totalization 
of 
everything 
and 
irreducible 
to 
a 
pure 
abstract 
unity 
of 
that 
which 
it 
totalizes
ii
58
EOS
the 
universal
the 
totality
can 
only 
be 
known 
through 
the 
singular
EOS
but 
its 
future 
direction 
remains 
unknown 
and 
indeterminate
EOS
at 
the 
same 
time 
sartre 
makes 
a 
larger
though 
less 
persuasive 
claim 
that  
the 
boxing-match 
also 
works 
synecdochally 
and 
re-exteriorizes 
a 
more 
fundamental 
violence
namely 
the 
interiorized 
condition 
of 
scarcity 
that 
he 
considers 
to 
be 
the 
basis 
of 
conflict 
in 
general
EOS
the 
boxing 
match 
is 
the 
public 
incarnation 
of 
all 
conflict
ii
32
totalizing

its

struggle 
the 
whole

thus 
one 
can 
and 
must 
say
that 
each 
fight 
is 
the 
singularisation 
of 
all 
the 
circumstances 
of 
the 
social 
whole 
in 
movement 
and 
that 
by 
this 
singularisation
it 
incarnates 
the 
enveloping 
totalization 
which 
the 
historical 
process 
is
EOS
ii

EOS
but 
then 
he 
adds
i 
have 
said 
and 
i 
repeat 
that 
we 
have 
not 
yet 
proved 
that 
this 
enveloping 
totalization 
exists
EOS
so
although 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
conceive 
of 
any 
event 
as 
an 
incarnation 
of 
the 
totality
insofar 
as 
it 
must 
itself 
make 
up 
a 
part 
of 
that 
totality 
in 
its 
determination
unlike 
the 
case 
of 
the 
boxing 
match
where 
we 
can 
define 
the 
overall 
entity 
boxing
it 
still 
remains 
unproven 
that 
an 
overall 
entity
history
can 
be 
said 
to 
exist 
at 
all
EOS
for 
all 
his 
use 
of 
the 
model 
of 
the 
boxing 
match
sartre 
has 
really 
got 
no 
further 
with 
the 
fundamental 
question 
of 
how 
there 
can 
be 
totalization 
without 
a 
totalizer
EOS
it 
is 
simple 
enough 
for 
him 
to 
show 
that 
a 
boxing 
match 
takes 
place 
within 
a 
general 
totality 
of 
boxing
which 
is 
itself 
only 
ever 
present 
in 
any 
individual 
incarnation
for 
as 
a 
game 
each 
match 
is 
both 
an 
individual 
bout 
and 
something 
conducted 
according 
to 
general 
rules 
and 
a 
specific 
social 
tradition
EOS
but 
what 
about 
those 
conflicts 
that 
do 
not 
take 
place 
within 
such 
a 
constituted 
social 
system
such 
as 
conflictual 
bourgeois 
societies 
which 
can
not 
be 
said 
to 
be 
unified
except
as 
sartre 
suggests 
dismissively
by 
appeal 
to 
a 
lost 
paradise 
before 
the 
class 
struggle
EOS
such 
societies 
make 
the 
conflicts 
of 
history 
irreducible 
to 
sartre
's 
logic 
unless
like 
the 
boxing 
match
they 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
take 
part 
in 
a 
larger 
totalizable 
category
EOS
however
when 
he 
poses 
the 
question 
of 
whether 
his 
method 
could 
work 
as 
well 
for 
the 
class 
struggle 
as 
for 
the 
boxing 
match
sartre 
admits 
that 
he 
finds 
it 
impossible 
to 
answer 
and 
returns 
instead 
to 
the 
much 
easier 
case 
of 
sub-groups
EOS
once 
again 
he 
backtracks 
and 
assumes 
a 
larger 
unity 
in 
which 
conflict 
takes 
place
EOS
the 
major 
question 
thus 
always 
remains 
unanswered 
in 
the 
critique 
every 
time 
that 
sartre 
announces 
that 
he 
is 
about 
to 
proceed 
with 
the 
fundamental 
problem 
of 
how 
history 
can 
be 
a 
totalization 
without 
a 
totalizer
he 
turns 
back 
to 
a 
previous
more 
easily 
intelligible 
stage 
on 
the 
way
EOS
his 
difficulty 
is 
accompanied 
by 
a 
no 
doubt 
symptomatic 
increasing 
distrust 
of 
universals 
so 
that
in 
championing 
specificities 
against 
them
he 
seems 
to 
give 
up 
the 
attempt 
to 
validate 
the 
universals 
history 
as 
totalization 
that 
originally 
formed 
the 
object 
of 
his 
project
EOS
at 
this 
point 
a 
further 
contradiction 
in 
sartre
's 
whole 
enterprise 
begins 
to 
open 
up
for 
someone 
so 
deeply 
distrustful 
of 
universals 
it 
seems 
curious 
that 
he 
has 
involved 
himself 
so 
emphatically 
with 
the 
notions 
of 
totality
history
and  
the 
dialectic
EOS
as 
sartre 
insists 
more 
and 
more 
upon 
the 
virtues 
of 
specificity 
ii
200 
05
such 
is 
his 
distaste 
for 
marxist 
or 
any 
other 
universalizing 
categories 
that 
he 
refuses 
even 
to 
countenance 
them
attempting 
to 
replace 
concepts 
with 
specificities
universals 
with 
singulars
EOS
his 
scepticism 
goes 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
even 
denying 
the 
existence 
of 
society
or 
the 
nation
as 
such 
ii
24
61
the 
very 
totalities 
which 
his 
own 
general 
argument 
for 
totalization 
requires
EOS
here 
certain 
similarities 
with 
later 
post-marxist
theorists 
such 
as 
foucault 
or 
lyotard
begin 
to 
become 
apparent
EOS
but 
if 
sartre 
anticipates 
such 
later 
thinkers 
we 
should 
not 
assume 
too 
quickly 
that 
they 
have 
simply 
taken 
his 
insights 
further
EOS
for 
sartre
's 
singular 
universal 
could 
never 
be 
expected 
to 
solve 
the 
formal 
theoretical 
problem 
of 
how 
individual 
existential 
existence 
can 
be 
related 
to 
history 
insofar 
as 
it 
simply 
renames
in 
one 
oxymoronic 
category
the 
original 
antithetical 
terms
EOS
without 
an 
adequate 
theory 
of 
their 
articulation
they 
simply 
begin 
to 
separate 
again
EOS
iv 
the 
ambivalence 
of 
history
EOS
the 
singular 
universal
with 
its 
organicist 
and 
essentialist 
overtones 
whereby 
the 
part 
incarnates 
the 
whole
is 
thus 
the 
product 
of 
sartre
's 
hesitation 
between 
the 
singular
which 
remains 
privileged 
as 
the 
existential 
basis 
of 
history
and 
the 
universal 
which 
as 
a 
marxist 
he 
feels 
is 
required 
for 
its 
intelligibility 
and 
validation
EOS
the 
effect 
of 
sartre
's 
oscillation 
between 
these 
two 
poles 
is 
that 
his 
argument 
is 
increasingly 
drawn 
towards 
the 
very 
positions 
that 
ostensibly 
he 
wishes 
to 
refute
EOS
so
for 
example
he 
compulsively 
returns 
to 
the 
idea 
that 
history 
might 
consist 
of 
several 
totalizations 
rather 
than 
one
EOS
might 
not 
history
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
grand 
ensembles
be 
an 
ambiguous 
interpenetration 
of 
unity 
and 
plurality
of 
dialectic 
and 
anti-dialectic
of 
sense 
and 
nonsense
EOS
might 
there 
not 
be
according 
to 
the 
circumstances 
and 
the 
particular 
ensemble
several 
totalizations 
without 
any 
links 
between 
them 
except 
coexistence 
or 
no 
matter 
what 
other 
exterior 
link
EOS
ii
131
EOS
up 
to 
this 
point
sartre
's 
notion 
of 
conflict 
has 
operated 
in 
direct 
antithesis 
to 
that 
of 
bakhtin
whereas 
for 
sartre
struggles 
are 
totalizing
always 
creating 
a 
larger
meaningful 
and 
developing 
whole 
out 
of 
multiplicities
for 
bakhtin 
they 
are 
detotalizing
dissolving 
previous 
totalisations
EOS
but 
sartre
's 
own 
text 
here 
develops 
a 
dialogism 
in 
the 
tension 
between 
these 
two 
possibilities 
which 
becomes 
an 
increasingly 
dominant 
characteristic 
of 
his 
regressive-progressive 
method 
and 
ends 
up 
by 
detotalizing 
the 
very 
totalization 
which 
he 
sought 
to 
prove
EOS
here 
we 
find 
the 
theoretical 
corollary 
of 
what 
althusser 
was 
to 
characterize 
as 
the 
tragic 
double 
thesis
of 
sartre
's 
historicist 
humanism
and 
which 
produced
in 
michael 
sprinker
's 
words
a 
ceaseless 
rebounding  
between 
the 
poles 
of 
revolutionary 
optimism 
and 
historical 
pessimism
EOS
sartre 
himself 
theorizes 
this 
growing 
ambivalence 
as 
the 
difference 
between 
his 
own 
method 
and 
that 
of 
orthodox 
marxism
elaborating 
the 
distinction 
between 
concept 
and 
incarnation 
as 
two 
possible 
paths 
of 
a 
dialectical 
understanding 
of 
the 
same 
social 
reality
EOS
the 
concept
as 
employed 
by 
orthodox 
marxism
goes 
from 
the 
singular 
to 
the 
universal 
and 
therefore
sartre 
claims
detotalizes 
in 
a 
movement 
of 
decompressive 
expansion
whereas 
incarnation 
involves 
a 
way 
of 
totalizing 
compression 
which
on 
the 
contrary
seizes 
the 
centripetal 
movement 
of 
all 
the 
significations 
drawn 
in 
and 
condensed 
in 
the 
event 
or 
in 
the 
object
ii
59
EOS
but 
it 
is 
rather 
sartre
's 
own 
text 
that 
seems 
to 
be 
caught 
between 
these 
two 
dialectical 
possibilities 
of 
expansion 
and 
compression 
in 
a 
double 
logic
EOS
thus 
the 
very 
concept 
of 
totalization
distinguished 
from 
totality
must 
always 
be 
refused 
its 
prospective 
closure
for 
if 
history 
continually 
effects 
totalisation 
of 
totalisations
i
15
it 
must 
necessarily 
also 
mean 
that 
by 
definition 
it 
can 
never 
be 
absolutely 
totalized
EOS
as 
he 
puts 
it 
in 
the 
problem 
of 
method 
for 
us 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
collective 
object 
rests 
on 
recurrence 
EOS
it 
demonstrates 
that 
the 
totalization 
is 
never 
achieved 
and 
that 
the 
totality 
exists 
at 
best 
only 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
detotalized 
totality 
EOS
how 
then 
can 
history 
totalize 
totalization 
if 
totalization 
is 
never 
accomplished
EOS
this 
is 
the 
point 
at 
which 
the 
dialectic
as 
a 
unity 
of 
method 
and 
movement
of 
subject 
and 
object
knower 
and 
known
requires 
the 
writing 
subject 
who 
must 
effectively 
hold 
them 
together
EOS
thus 
the 
critical 
investigation
EOS
takes 
place 
inside 
the 
totalisation 
and 
can 
be 
neither 
a 
contemplative 
recognition 
of 
the 
totalising 
movement
nor 
a 
particular
autonomous 
totalisation 
of 
the 
known 
totalisation
EOS
rather 
it 
is 
a 
real 
moment 
of 
the 
developing 
totalisation
EOS
i
48
EOS
this 
means 
that 
the 
process 
of 
totalization 
must 
be 
kept 
moving 
by 
the 
critical 
investigation 
itself 
on 
which 
it 
comes 
to 
depend 
but 
which 
by 
the 
same 
token 
it 
can 
never 
subsume
EOS
every 
time 
that 
sartre 
asserts 
the 
enveloping 
movement 
of 
the 
historical 
process
while 
adding 
emphatically 
that 
he 
has 
yet 
not 
proved 
that 
such 
a 
totalization 
exists
he 
must 
always 
simultaneously 
introduce 
a 
counterstructure 
of 
repetition
so 
that 
his 
argument 
seems 
to 
fluctuate
like 
the 
groups 
that 
he 
describes
in 
a 
state 
of 
perpetual 
detotalisation 
i
579
EOS
this 
is 
why 
although 
he 
dares 
to 
pose 
his 
overwhelming 
question
he 
can 
never 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
answer 
it 
with 
more 
than 
an 
assertion 
and 
the 
promise 
of 
more 
totalizations
EOS
the 
indetermination 
he 
sought 
to 
excise 
returns 
to 
govern 
him
EOS
the 
critiques 
can 
do 
nothing 
but 
proliferate 
extravagantly 
into 
the 
writing 
of 
a 
perpetual 
process 
of 
deferral
EOS
if 
the 
singular 
universal 
increasingly 
punctuates 
the 
forward 
movement 
of 
sartre
's 
text 
instead 
of 
providing 
it 
with 
a 
dialectical 
meaning 
and 
direction
the 
problem 
that 
it 
was 
invoked 
to 
solve 
meanwhile 
takes 
its 
own 
aberrant 
course
EOS
denying 
that 
conflict 
is 
an 
a 
priori 
structure 
actualized 
in 
historical  
struggle
we 
have 
seen 
that 
sartre 
does 
explain
through 
the 
category 
of 
the 
practico-inert
determining 
material 
conditions 
which 
have 
themselves 
been 
created 
by 
previous 
praxis
how 
individuals 
or 
classes 
in 
conflict 
produce 
a 
historical 
movement 
to 
which 
they 
are 
then 
subject
EOS
actions
in 
turn
create 
the 
conditions 
for 
their 
own 
contradiction 
when 
the 
successful 
fulfilment 
of 
praxis 
is 
prevented 
by 
the 
action 
of 
another 
praxis 
whose 
aims 
conflict 
with 
it
EOS
the 
fact 
that 
conflict 
produces 
anti-labour
or 
a 
contingent 
situation 
that 
was 
not 
the 
original 
aim 
of 
either 
conflictual 
group
must 
mean 
that 
in 
this 
schema 
history 
has 
a 
negative 
unity
notwithstanding 
the 
troubled 
formulation 
of 
the 
singular-universal
EOS
if 
sartre 
denies 
all 
possibility 
both 
of 
an 
underlying 
historical 
structure 
and 
of 
a 
larger 
unity
a 
hyper-organism
as 
he 
puts 
it
within 
which 
conflict 
takes 
place
then 
history 
as 
he 
conceptualizes 
it 
here 
has 
no 
specific 
or 
necessary 
direction
EOS
more 
seriously
it 
suggests 
that 
history 
will 
always 
deviate 
from 
any 
intended 
route 
and 
take 
an 
unforeseen 
one 
instead
EOS
if 
political 
struggle 
takes 
place 
for 
specific 
purposes 
and 
anticipated 
results
here 
sartre 
seems 
to 
condemn 
it 
to 
an 
unending 
series 
of 
detours 
that 
will 
never 
arrive 
at 
their 
destination
EOS
insofar 
as
history
names 
the 
horizon 
of 
totalization 
of 
those 
ethico-political 
meanings 
that 
point 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
social 
change
it 
here 
not 
only 
loses 
its 
single 
meaning
but 
threatens 
to 
lose 
even 
the 
bases 
on 
which 
its 
meaning 
is 
constituted
EOS
sartre
therefore
can
not 
after 
all 
be 
said 
to 
substitute 
a 
simple 
voluntarism 
for 
an 
underlying 
historical 
structure
EOS
in 
the 
second 
critique 
sartre 
seems 
remarkably 
equivocal 
with 
regard 
to 
his 
central 
question 
of 
how 
struggles 
which 
have 
no 
controlling 
totalizer 
or 
underlying 
structure 
of 
totalization 
can 
be 
intelligible
EOS
he 
begins 
by 
allowing 
the 
possibility 
of 
schism
such 
as 
that 
which 
took 
place 
in 
the 
roman 
empire 
ii
84
which 
implies 
that 
humans 
can 
choose 
not 
to 
allow 
totalization
EOS
he 
then 
admits 
that 
the 
result 
of 
any 
conflict
though 
it 
may 
be 
intelligible
may 
not 
necessarily 
imply 
any 
progress
EOS
progress 
or 
improvement 
is 
no 
more 
likely 
than 
decline
he 
now 
repeatedly 
disowns 
any 
necessary 
historical 
logic 
of 
progress
its 
incarnations 
will 
always
strictly 
speaking
be 
accidental 
ones 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
objectives 
which 
were 
at 
the 
origin 
of 
praxis
EOS
history
is 
not 
rigorous 
because 
it 
always 
proceeds 
by 
faults 
and 
corrections
because 
it 
is 
not 
in 
any 
way 
a 
universal 
schema 
but 
a 
unique 
adventure 
that 
unfolds 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
prehistoric 
circumstances 
which 
constitute 
in 
themselves
and 
in 
relation 
to 
all 
the

all 
the

a 
heavy 
and 
badly 
understood 
legacy

EOS
history 
therefore 
does 
have 
a 
structure 
of 
sorts 
a 
legacy 
of 
continual 
aberration
EOS
by 
abandoning 
any 
logic 
of 
progress 
for 
the 
negative 
synthesis 
of 
anti-labour 
which 
produces 
deviation
sartre 
is
on 
the 
other 
hand
able 
to  
account 
for 
the 
major 
detour 
that 
provides 
the 
context 
for 
his 
whole 
debate 
with 
merleau-ponty
and 
indeed 
for 
all 
post-war 
marxism
the 
spectre 
of 
stalinism
EOS
the 
problem
however
is 
that 
though 
sartre 
produces 
a 
provocative 
analysis 
of 
why 
stalin 
was 
successful
this 
imperceptibly 
slides 
into 
an 
account 
of 
why 
stalin 
had 
to 
do 
what 
he 
did
to 
the 
extent 
that 
sartre 
appears 
to 
justify 
his 
actions 
according 
to 
the 
particular 
necessities 
of 
his 
historical 
circumstances
EOS
thus 
sartre 
argues 
that 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
choose 
between 
the 
break-up 
of 
the 
revolution 
and 
its 
deviation
EOS
stalinism
in 
fact
accords 
all 
too 
perfectly 
with 
the 
perverse 
structures 
of 
sartre
's 
own 
theoretical 
argument
EOS
it 
also 
serves
appropriately 
enough
as 
a 
way 
of 
closing 
down 
the 
aporias

EOS
sartre 
takes 
the 
slogan 
socialism 
in 
one 
country
as 
an 
example 
of 
the 
unintended 
but 
necessary 
product 
of 
the 
anti-labour 
of 
the 
stalin-trotsky 
conflict
EOS
he 
translates 
the 
socialism 
in 
one 
country
of 
the 
one 
versus 
the 
internationalism
of 
the 
other 
into 
a 
conflict 
between 
his 
own
now 
reified 
and 
separated
terms 
of 
concrete 
incarnation 
and 
abstract 
universalism
the 
revolutionary 
incarnation 
chose 
the 
singular 
against 
the 
universal 
and 
the 
national 
against 
the 
international' 
ii

EOS
stalin 
therefore 
becomes 
the 
authentic 
marxist
able 
to 
deal 
with 
specific 
historical 
circumstances
as 
against 
trotsky 
who 
is 
regarded 
as 
having 
been 
hopelessly 
caught 
up 
with 
the 
a 
priori 
universalism 
of 
an 
abstract 
marxism
EOS
according 
to 
sartre
the 
revolution
's 
incarnation 
directly 
contradicts 
its 
universalization
ii

EOS
if 
he 
therefore 
demonstrates 
why 
socialism 
in 
one 
country 
was 
historically 
necessary
he 
ends 
up 
by 
apparently 
justifying 
stalinism
in 
showing 
how 
anti-labour 
produces 
deviation
he 
seems 
to 
endorse 
its 
course 
while 
rejecting 
any 
overall 
schema 
which 
can 
provide 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
claim 
that 
it 
will 
be 
ultimately 
corrected
EOS
the 
analysis 
stops 
at 
the 
point 
where 
even 
stalin
's 
anti-semitism 
begins 
to 
appear 
necessary 
ii
281
EOS
sartre 
never 
broaches 
the 
question 
of 
the 
other 
crimes 
committed 
by 
stalin 
which 
is 
just 
as 
well 
in 
view 
of 
the 
way 
the 
argument 
is 
going
nor 
does 
he 
address 
the 
obvious 
problem 
that 
his 
own 
identification 
of 
stalin 
as 
the 
practical 
marxist 
of 
specificities 
against 
trotsky
's 
abstract 
universalism 
runs 
directly 
counter 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
stalinism 
produced 
the 
most 
clear-cut 
example 
of 
a 
marxism 
which 
internalized 
an 
abstract 
schema 
within 
itself
EOS
instead
at 
this 
point 
sartre 
at 
last 
abandons 
all 
hope 
of 
proving 
history 
as 
a 
totalization 
without 
a 
totalizer
EOS
he 
moves 
into 
a 
long 
attempt
which 
takes 
up 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
book
to 
revise 
the 
earlier 
ontology 
of 
being 
and 
nothingness 
into 
a 
new 
ontology 
of 
action 
and 
even 
of 
history
as 
if 
after 
all
he 
is 
investigating 
the 
prospect 
of 
accrediting 
the 
latter 
with 
ontological 
status 
a 
possibility 
which 
has 
always 
haunted 
his 
text 
in 
its 
insistent 
negation
EOS
this 
analysis
though 
lengthy
remains 
incomplete
EOS
in 
studying 
the 
deviation
sartre 
himself 
deviated 
from 
his 
original 
project
EOS
but 
this 
was 
not 
just 
the 
effect 
of 
stalin 
per 
se 
despite 
his 
perverse 
attraction 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
singular-universal 
who 
did 
in 
effect 
unite 
man
with 
history
it 
was 
also 
the 
result 
of 
the  
theoretical 
collapse 
of 
the 
singular-universal 
as 
a 
totalizing 
concept 
that 
could 
save 
history 
from 
the 
aberrant 
consequences 
of 
anti-labour
EOS
sartre
's 
philosophical 
grounding 
of 
history
therefore
foundered 
in 
the 
second 
volume 
when 
the 
logic 
of 
history 
inexorably 
brought 
him
not 
to 
totalization 
without 
a 
totalizer
but 
to 
the 
very 
reverse
the 
figure 
of 
stalin 
and 
the 
conclusion 
that 
stalinism 
had 
been 
indispensable 
for 
the 
development 
of 
socialism 
in 
the 
soviet 
union
EOS
although 
the 
critique 
had 
been 
intended 
to 
rescue 
marxism 
from 
the 
sclerosis 
of 
stalinism
sartre 
found 
that 
his 
theory 
of 
history
far 
from 
explaining 
what 
had 
gone 
wrong 
when 
the 
most 
radical 
political 
theory 
turned 
out 
in 
practice 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
most 
oppressive
had 
rather 
shown 
why 
it 
had 
necessarily 
happened 
that 
way
EOS
volume 
ii 
was 
never 
completed
and 
only 
published
unfinished
in 
1985
EOS
thus 
sartre
's 
attempt 
to 
prove 
the 
truth 
of 
marxism 
and 
of 
history 
at 
a 
philosophical 
level 
was 
abandoned
EOS
the 
basic 
theoretical 
problem 
had 
been 
to 
show 
how 
two 
or 
more 
autonomous 
and 
contradictory 
totalizations 
make 
up 
one 
dialectical 
intelligibility
to 
do 
this 
he 
needed 
to 
totalize 
the 
classes 
in 
struggle
and 
to 
discover 
the 
synthetic 
unity 
of 
a 
conflictual 
society
EOS
the 
articulation 
of 
individual 
praxis 
with 
history 
stood 
or 
fell 
with 
the 
concept 
of 
history 
as 
totalization 
without 
a 
totalizer
EOS
the 
stakes 
had 
been 
painfully 
clear 
to 
sartre 
himself
marxism 
is 
rigorously 
true 
if 
history 
is 
totalization
it 
is 
not 
so 
any 
more 
if 
human 
history 
decomposes 
into 
a 
plurality 
of 
particular 
histories
ii
25
EOS
the 
problem 
was 
that 
the 
premises 
of 
his 
own 
theory 
required 
the 
answer 
to 
this 
question 
to 
remain 
always 
in 
abeyance
while 
his 
text 
enacts 
rather 
than 
resolves 
the 
equivocality 
of 
the 
choice 
which 
it 
sets 
up
EOS
if 
sartre 
began 
by 
attempting 
to 
unite 
man 
with 
history
in 
the 
notes 
at 
the 
very 
end 
of 
the 
manuscript 
he 
poses 
once 
more 
the 
fundamental 
ontological 
question
and 
immediately 
follows 
it 
with 
a 
decidedly 
unequivocal 
answer

sartre
's 
argument 
for 
history 
as 
totalization
then
was 
already 
caught 
up 
in 
interminable 
difficulties 
by 
the 
time 
he 
was 
drafting 
volume 
ii 
of 
the 
critique 
in 
1958
EOS
no 
sooner 
had 
he 
published 
volume 
i 
in 
1960 
than 
the 
whole 
status 
that 
he 
claimed 
for 
history
for 
man
and 
for 
their 
articulation
came 
under 
attack
EOS
v 
history 
and 
ethnocentricity
EOS
the 
case 
of 
sartre 
demonstrates 
why 
the 
assertion 
of 
history
against 
structuralism 
and 
poststructuralism 
must 
always 
remain 
problematical
EOS
in 
this 
context 
it 
is 
ironic 
that 
it 
was 
a 
structuralist 
critique 
of 
sartre
's 
claims 
for 
history 
that
in 
historical 
terms
brought 
about 
the 
abrupt 
intellectual 
demise 
of 
existential 
marxism 
itself

lÃ©vi-strauss

famous 
objections 
to  
sartre
which 
appeared 
in

are 
sometimes 
represented 
as 
if 
they 
were 
merely 
a 
structuralist 
attack 
on

EOS
but 
their 
immediate 
occasion 
was

the

are 
organized

must 
show 
that 
the

of

EOS
for 
sartre 
human 
history
was 
identified 
with 
the 
history 
of 
the 
west
and 
it 
was 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
lÃ©vi-strauss 
contested 
sartre
's 
claim 
to 
have 
established 
the 
human 
foundation 
of 
a 
structural
historical 
anthropology
for 
marxism
EOS
in 
retrospect
it 
was 
highly 
significant 
that 
resistance 
to 
sartre
's 
history
began 
by 
drawing 
attention 
to 
its 
ethnocentrism 
and 
eurocentrism
EOS
lÃ©vi-strauss
' 
critique 
of 
sartre 
effectively 
takes 
the 
form 
of 
a 
deconstructive 
analysis
he 
begins 
by 
arguing 
that 
the 
critique 
works 
by 
a 
double 
movement 
just 
as
only 
four 
years 
later
derrida 
was 
to 
suggest 
that 
the 
anthropologist
's 
own 
work 
functions 
in 
exactly 
the 
same 
way
EOS
lÃ©vi-strauss 
focuses 
on 
the 
ambivalence 
which 
we 
have 
already 
seen 
to 
be 
such 
a 
distinctive 
feature 
of 
the 
critique 
pointing 
in 
particular 
to 
sartre
's 
vacillation 
between 
two 
concepts 
of 
dialectical 
reason
EOS
in 
the 
first 
he 
regards 
it 
as 
antithetical 
to 
analytical 
reason
as 
truth 
to 
error
while 
in 
the 
second 
he 
sees 
it 
as 
complementary 
to 
it
EOS
if 
this 
is 
the 
case
then 
lÃ©vi-strauss 
argues 
that 
sartre 
disqualifies 
his 
own 
critique 
which 
establishes 
the 
truth 
of 
dialectical 
reason 
partly 
through 
the 
exercise 
of 
analytical 
reason
as 
any 
critique
which 
separates 
subject 
from 
object
knower 
from 
known
inevitably 
must
EOS
but 
then 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
see 
how 
analytical 
reason 
could 
be 
applied 
to 
dialectical 
reason 
and 
claim 
to 
establish 
it
if 
the 
two 
are 
defined 
by 
mutually 
exclusive 
characteristics
EOS
moreover
if 
the 
two 
eventually 
arrive 
at 
the 
same 
truth 
anyway 
then 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
little 
need 
for 
dialectical 
reason 
at 
all
EOS
sartre
's 
endeavour 
seems 
contradictory 
in 
the 
one 
case 
and 
superfluous 
in 
the 
other

EOS
while 
stressing 
that 
they 
both 
take 
their 
point 
of 
departure

lÃ©vi-strauss

that 
for 
him 
marxism 
implies 
that
EOS
the 
opposition 
between 
the 
two 
sorts 
of 
reason 
is 
relative
not 
absolute

it 
corresponds 
to 
a

the

stricture
EOS
unknown 
to 
lÃ©vi-strauss
sartre 
himself 
had 
already 
proposed 
that 
dialectical 
understanding 
itself 
works 
along 
two 
paths
one 
of 
expansion
and 
one 
of 
compression
which  
suggests 
that 
having 
separated 
dialectical 
from 
analytical 
reason
he 
had 
then 
to 
reintroduce 
the 
latter 
under 
a 
new 
guise
EOS
the 
argument 
about 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
different 
kinds

will 
doubtless 
and 
necessarily
continue

what 
is 
important 
in 
the

that
in 
rearticulating 
the 
possibility 
that 
there 
is 
no 
absolute 
difference 
between

lÃ©vi-strauss 
puts 
into 
question 
sartre
's 
definitions 
of 
man
human 
history

finally 
his 
concept 
of

dialectic

conflict 
is 
the 
motive 
force 
of 
history

a

progressive 
dialectical

sartre 
claims 
that 
what 
he 
calls 
backward 
societies
have 
existed 
in 
a 
state 
of 
equilibrium 
and 
are 
therefore 
without 
history
EOS
he 
writes
EOS
there 
is 
no 
logical 
dialectical
absurdity 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
country 
with 
no 
history
where 
human 
groups 
would 
vegetate 
and 
never 
break 
out 
of 
a 
cycle 
of 
repetition
producing 
their 
lives

EOS
in 
the 
background

hegel
EOS
according 
to 
sartre
history 
is 
only 
born 
from 
a 
sudden 
imbalance 
of 
scarcity 
which 
disrupts 
all 
levels 
of 
society

initiates 
conflict 
and 
therefore 
progression
EOS
many 
have 
objected 
that 
this 
analysis 
is 
hardly 
marxist 
insofar 
as 
marxism 
takes 
the 
form 
of 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
misappropriation

lÃ©vi-strauss

objects

the

a 
good 
deal 
of 
egocentricity

naivety

necessary

taken 
refuge 
in 
a 
single 
one 
of 
the 
historical 
or 
geographical 
modes

his

sartre

ethnocentricity

lÃ©vi-strauss
' 
point 
here
however

simply 
the 
objection 
that

defines

by 
the 
particular

what 
it

sartre
as 
simon

takes 
the 
conscious 
rationalization

the 
ultimate 
meaning

but 
how 
can 
sartre 
claim 
to 
found 
a 
general 
anthropology 
when 
he 
defines 
it 
solely 
in 
terms 
of 
his 
own

as 
soon 
as 
lÃ©vi-strauss 
shows 
that 
the 
experience 
on 
which 
sartre 
bases 
his 
philosophy 
is 
not 
a 
universal 
one

the

having 
questioned 
the 
basis 
of 
sartre
's 
definition 
of 
man 
and 
the 
human 
according 
to 
the 
categories 
of 
civilization 
and 
primitivism
lÃ©vi-strauss 
focuses 
on 
this 
relation 
to 
history
EOS
it 
can
not
he 
argues
be 
tied 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
man
as 
if 
they 
were 
images 
of 
each 
other
EOS
we 
need 
only 
recognize 
that 
history 
is 
a 
method 
with 
no 
distinct 
object 
corresponding 
to 
it 
to 
reject 
the 
equivalence 
between 
the 
notion 
of 
history 
and 
the 
notion 
of 
humanity 
which 
some 
have 
tried 
to 
foist 
on 
us 
with 
the 
unavowed 
aim 
of 
making 
historicity 
the 
last 
refuge 
of 
a 
transcendental 
humanism
as 
if 
men 
could 
regain 
the 
illusion 
of 
liberty 
on 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
we
merely 
by 
giving 
up 
the 
i
's 
that 
are 
too 
obviously 
wanting 
in 
consistency
EOS
262
EOS
in 
other 
words
sartre
's 
attempt 
to 
combine 
marxism 
with 
existentialist 
subjectivity 
can
not 
resolve 
its 
difficulties 
through 
a 
shift 
from 
economism 
to 
history
for 
history 
implicitly 
continues 
to 
fulfil 
the 
same 
function 
anyway
EOS
here 
lÃ©vi-strauss 
argues 
that 
behind 
the 
original 
question 
from 
which 
sartre 
began 
how 
can 
man 
make 
history 
if 
history 
makes 
him
lurks 
another
if 
it 
is 
man 
who 
makes 
history
how 
does 
history
gain 
its 
exorbitant 
status 
as 
the 
desired
unachievable 
object 
of 
sartre
's 
text
EOS
his 
emphasis 
on 
the 
primacy 
of 
history 
means 
that 
he 
forms 
an 
almost 
mystical 
conception 
of 
it
EOS
sartre 
seems 
to 
have 
remembered 
only 
half 
of 
marx
's 
and 
freud
's 
combined 
lesson
EOS
they 
have 
taught 
us 
that 
man 
has 
meaning 
only 
on 
the 
condition 
that 
he 
view 
himself 
as 
meaningful
EOS
so 
far 
i 
agree 
with 
sartre
EOS
but 
it 
must 
be 
added 
that 
this 
meaning 
is 
never 
the 
right 
one 
superstructures 
are 
faulty 
acts 
which 
have 
made 
it
socially
EOS
hence 
it 
is 
vain 
to 
go 
to 
historical 
consciousness 
for 
the 
truest 
meaning
EOS
253
EOS
historical 
consciousness 
is 
necessarily 
ideological
even 
if 
dialectical
and 
can 
never 
in 
itself 
provide 
the 
one 
true 
meaning 
of 
history
EOS
despite 
sartre
's 
reiteration 
that 
it 
is 
man 
who 
makes 
it
history 
increasingly 
assumes 
its 
own 
ontological 
status 
in 
the 
critiques 
EOS
above 
all
lÃ©vi-strauss 
questions 
its 
status 
as 
totalization
EOS
the 
idea 
of 
history 
as 
the 
totalization 
of 
totalizations 
does 
not 
work
EOS
how 
total
he 
asks 
in 
a 
critique 
of 
totalization 
which 
derrida 
would 
characterize 
as 
his 
first 
classical
formulation
can 
the 
totalization 
be
EOS
can 
it 
include 
every 
historical 
fact
EOS
history 
names 
the 
process 
of 
constituting 
historical 
facts
and
particularly
of 
their 
selection
EOS
a 
history 
that 
included 
everything 
would 
amount 
to 
chaos
EOS
in 
so 
far 
as 
history 
aspires 
to 
meaning
it 
is 
doomed 
to 
select 
regions
periods
groups 
of 
men 
and 
individuals 
in 
these 
groups 
and 
to 
make 
them 
stand 
out
as 
discontinuous 
figures
against 
a 
continuity 
barely 
good 
enough 
to 
be 
used 
as 
a 
backdrop
EOS
a 
truly 
total 
history 
would 
cancel 
itself 
out 
its 
product 
would 
be 
nought
EOS
257
EOS
meaning 
works 
through 
a 
form 
of 
metonymy
distinguishing 
between 
elements 
in 
terms 
of 
significance 
and 
insignificance
and 
that 
is 
why 
it 
must 
always 
be 
partial 
in 
relation 
to 
any 
text 
it 
interprets
EOS
we 
might 
compare 
this 
to 
the 
way 
in 
which
in 
sartre
's 
later 
text
the 
synecdoche 
of 
the 
singular-universal 
insistently 
slides 
into 
the 
singularity 
of 
the 
event
EOS
totalization 
in 
the 
first 
critique 
lÃ©vi-strauss 
suggests
can 
only 
create 
its 
meaning 
by 
selection 
through 
such 
metonymic 
devices 
of 
exclusion
that 
is
by 
founding 
itself 
on 
an 
ethnocentric 
absence
EOS
historical 
consciousness 
dehistoricizes 
by 
shifting 
diachrony 
into 
a 
single 
synchronic 
totality
EOS
and 
so 
we 
end 
up 
in 
the 
paradox 
of 
a 
system 
which 
invokes 
the 
criterion 
of 
historical 
consciousness 
as 
a 
means 
for 
distinguishing 
the 
primitive
from 
the
civilized' 
but 
contrary 
to 
its 
claim 
is 
itself 
ahistorical
EOS
it 
offers 
not 
a 
concrete 
image 
of 
history 
but 
an 
abstract 
schema 
of 
men 
making 
history 
of 
such 
a 
kind 
that 
it 
can 
manifest 
itself 
in 
the 
trend 
of 
their 
lives 
as 
a 
synchronic 
totality
EOS
its 
position 
in 
relation 
to 
history 
is 
therefore 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
primitives 
to 
the 
eternal 
past
in 
sartre
's 
system
history 
plays 
exactly 
the 
part 
of 
a 
myth
EOS
254
EOS
history
far 
from 
constituting 
a 
privileged 
form 
of 
historical
knowledge
is 
simply 
the 
myth 
of 
modern 
man
and 
merely 
amounts 
to 
a 
method 
of 
analysis
EOS
for 
all 
its 
stress 
on 
history 
and 
totalization 
as 
process
sartre
's 
argument 
is 
structured 
through 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
form 
of 
synchronicity
EOS
lÃ©vi-strauss 
demonstrates 
this 
through 
his 
well-known 
discussion 
of 
the 
function 
of 
the 
category 
of 
time
EOS
like 
all 
models 
of 
knowledge
he 
suggests
history 
requires 
a 
code 
to 
analyse 
its 
object
and 
for 
most 
historians 
this 
code 
consists 
in 
chronology
EOS
the 
use 
of 
chronology 
in 
historical 
writing
or 
in 
literary 
history
gives 
the 
illusion 
that 
the 
whole 
operates 
by 
a 
uniform
continuous 
progression
a 
linear 
series 
in 
which 
each 
event 
takes 
its 
place
EOS
history 
is 
thus 
a 
process 
of 
a 
continuous 
unfolding
EOS
but 
in 
fact
lÃ©vi-strauss 
argues
the 
process 
model 
of  
history 
is 
an 
illusion
for 
even 
dates 
do 
not 
work 
like 
that
EOS
dates 
only 
work 
by 
being 
a 
member 
of 
a 
class
EOS
in 
itself
a 
date 
tells 
us 
nothing
it 
only 
takes 
on 
meaning 
when 
it 
is 
part 
of 
a 
series
EOS
however 
that 
class 
does 
not 
necessarily 
correspond 
to 
other 
sets 
of 
dates
periods
millennia
ages
etc
EOS
history 
is 
a 
discontinuous 
set 
composed 
of 
domains 
of 
history
each 
of 
which 
is 
defined 
by 
a 
characteristic 
frequency 
and 
by 
a 
differential 
coding 
of 
before 
and 
after 
EOS
it 
is 
no 
more 
possible 
to 
pass 
between 
the 
dates 
which 
compose 
the 
different 
domains 
than 
it 
is 
to 
do 
so 
between 
natural 
and 
irrational 
numbers
EOS
or 
more 
precisely
the 
dates 
appropriate 
to 
each 
class 
are 
irrational 
to 
all 
those 
of 
other 
classes
EOS
259 
60
EOS
so-called 
historical 
continuity 
is 
therefore 
often 
fraudulently 
constructed 
out 
of 
discontinuous 
sets 
which 
each 
have 
different 
temporalities
EOS
history 
can 
neither 
be 
total
nor 
a 
simple 
series 
of 
facts
nor 
a 
continuity
EOS
the 
fact 
that 
it 
must 
always 
involve 
codification 
and 
therefore 
also 
interpretation 
means 
that 
historical 
knowledge 
has 
no 
claim 
to 
be 
opposed 
to 
other 
forms 
of 
knowledge 
as 
a 
supremely 
privileged 
one
263
EOS
historicity 
is 
a 
mode 
of 
knowledge 
for 
some 
societies 
but 
can
not 
ipso 
facto 
claim 
to 
be 
the 
fundamental 
basis 
of 
knowledge 
for 
all 
of 
them 
a 
point 
that 
was 
to 
be 
re-emphasized 
by 
foucault 
in 
the 
order 
of 
things 
EOS
it 
is 
thus 
far 
from 
the 
case 
that 
the 
search 
for 
intelligibility 
comes 
to 
an 
end 
with 
history 
as 
such
EOS
lÃ©vi-strauss 
therefore 
makes 
three 
major 
criticisms 
of 
sartre
's 
concept 
of 
history
EOS
in 
the 
first 
place
he 
contests 
its 
equation 
with 
any 
anthropological 
definition 
of 
man
in 
the 
second
he 
argues 
that 
sartre
's 
description 
of 
history 
as 
making 
up 
one 
history
with 
one 
meaning 
is 
only 
achieved 
through 
the 
exclusion 
of 
all 
other 
histories 
with 
other 
meanings
the 
totalization 
can 
only 
totalize 
if 
everything 
which 
remains 
other 
to 
it 
is 
excluded
EOS
sartre
's 
definition 
is 
therefore 
tautological
it 
is 
one 
history 
because 
it 
is 
only
one 
history
EOS
specifically
sartre 
creates 
a 
single 
history 
by 
excluding 
all 
histories 
except 
that 
of 
the 
west
his 
history 
as 
totalization 
can 
therefore 
only 
work 
through 
a 
determined 
ethnocentricity
EOS
in 
the 
third 
place
even 
in 
its 
own 
terms
the 
concept 
of 
history 
as 
a 
continuous 
development
a 
progressive 
totalization 
of 
totalizations
is 
dependent 
on 
a 
notion 
of 
chronology 
which 
assumes 
a 
synchronic 
homogeneous 
notion 
of 
time
EOS
but 
even 
historical 
chronology 
works 
through 
discontinuous 
sets
the 
elements 
in 
each 
class 
being 
defined 
only 
differentially 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
others 
in 
its 
class
EOS
this 
final 
criticism 
amounts 
to 
the 
challenge 
that 
sartre
's 
history 
can 
only 
ever 
be 
theorized 
as 
totalization 
insofar 
as 
it 
has 
been 
conceptualized 
as 
a 
synchronic 
form
EOS
while 
the 
criticism 
that 
lÃ©vi-strauss
structuralism 
emphasizes 
the 
synchronic 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
diachronic 
has 
assumed 
the 
status 
of 
a 
critical 
truism
this 
in 
fact 
repeats 
the 
substance 
of 
his 
critique 
of 
sartre
namely 
that 
the 
latter 
attempted 
to 
transform 
history 
into 
a 
space 
of 
synchronicity
EOS
indeed 
totality 
in 
both 
critiques 
presupposes 
a 
homogeneous 
temporality
the 
singular 
universal 
could 
only  
ever 
work 
by 
presupposing 
what 
althusser 
would 
call 
an 
essential 
section
EOS
lÃ©vi-strauss 
himself
like 
althusser 
and 
foucault
was 
preoccupied 
with 
the 
conceptualization 
of 
forms 
of 
heterogeneous 
temporality 
that 
consistently 
elude 
and 
trouble 
all 
theorization 
of 
history 
as 
a 
homogeneous 
diachrony
EOS
lÃ©vi-strauss
' 
attack
together 
with 
sartre
's 
own 
theoretical 
difficulties 
which 
have 
already 
been 
charted
was 
effective 
enough 
to 
be 
quite 
devastating 
to 
the 
project 
of 
the 
critique 
which 
was 
never 
completed
EOS
sartre 
took 
four 
years 
to 
respond
and 
when 
the 
reply 
eventually 
came 
even 
his 
most 
sympathetic 
admirers 
agreed 
that 
it 
did 
not 
succeed 
in 
answering 
the 
main 
criticisms
EOS
lÃ©vi-strauss
' 
objections 
to 
sartre
's 
theory 
of 
history 
on 
the 
grounds 
of 
its 
ethnocentrism 
was 
certainly 
to 
the 
point
demonstrating 
that 
one 
lesson 
of 
sartre
's 
herculean 
attempt 
to 
make 
history 
truth
and 
to 
give 
it 
one 
meaning
was 
the 
relation 
of 
such 
history 
to 
western 
cultural 
imperialism
EOS
at 
the 
same 
time 
we 
should 
also 
recall 
that
as 
levinas 
puts 
it 
the 
best 
thing 
about 
philosophy 
is 
that 
it 
fails
EOS
to 
the 
extent 
that 
sartre
's 
ontology 
does 
not 
succeed 
in 
totalizing 
history
it 
remains 
open 
to 
its 
irreducible 
otherness
EOS
perhaps 
this 
is 
one 
reason 
why
despite 
the 
eurocentrism 
of 
his 
intended 
historical 
schema
sartre 
himself 
could 
certainly 
not 
be 
accused 
of 
ethnocentrism 
in 
his 
politics
already 
the 
first 
critique 
contains 
substantial 
analyses 
of 
the 
political 
and 
psychological 
structures 
of 
colonialism 
and 
racism
even 
if 
they 
have 
to 
be
as 
always
dissolved 
in 
history 
i
716
EOS
but 
this 
still 
allows 
sartre 
to 
argue
for 
example
for 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
the 
use 
of 
violence 
by 
colonized 
peoples 
against 
their 
oppressors
thus 
anticipating 
fanon
's 
dictum 
that 
colonization 
was 
achieved 
by 
violence 
and 
must 
therefore 
be 
overcome 
with 
it
EOS
aronson 
sees 
sartre
's 
turn 
to 
the 
cause 
of 
resisting 
colonial 
oppression 
as 
an 
act 
of 
self-flagellation
and 
a 
product 
of 
politico-theoretical 
despair
but 
this 
passes 
over 
the 
historical 
and 
political 
context 
in 
which 
sartre
and 
les 
temps 
modernes 
played 
a 
leading 
role 
in 
the 
opposition 
to 
the 
algerian 
war
EOS
in 
retrospect 
these 
concerns 
now 
seem 
a 
much 
bolder 
move
constituting 
an 
important 
political 
lead 
which 
was 
to 
be 
continued 
in 
the 
resistance 
to 
the 
war 
in 
south-east 
asia 
in 
the 
sixties 
and 
early 
seventies
EOS
but 
sartre
's 
courageous 
intervention 
against 
french 
and 
other 
colonialisms 
could 
not 
have 
a 
corresponding 
theoretical 
impact 
so 
long 
as 
he 
retained 
his 
historicist 
marxist 
framework
EOS
for 
his 
unitary 
theory 
of 
history 
has 
the 
effect 
of 
disallowing 
radical 
attempts 
at 
rewriting 
or 
retrieving 
other 
histories 
excluded 
by 
the 
west
EOS
although 
it 
was 
taken 
by 
many 
as 
an 
attack 
on 
history 
as 
such
it 
was 
the 
critique 
of 
marxist 
historicism 
initiated 
by 
althusser 
that 
enabled 
new 
political 
possibilities 
in 
this 
direction
EOS
the 
scientific 
critique 
of 
historicism
EOS
before 
sartre 
had 
even 
replied 
to 
levi-strauss 
criticisms
althusser 
had 
published 
for 
marx 
1965
a 
work 
which
together 
with 
the 
later 
volume 
reading 
capital 
1968
far 
from 
defending 
sartre
's 
marxism 
from 
the 
structuralist 
challenge
completed 
the 
move 
against 
it
and 
offered 
a 
new 
interpretation 
of 
marxism 
from 
which 
humanist 
existentialism 
and 
hegelianism 
had 
been 
resolutely 
purged
with 
sartre
's 
voluntarism 
replaced 
by 
a 
more 
mediated 
form 
of 
economism
EOS
it 
is 
easy 
to 
represent 
althusser
's 
intervention 
purely 
in 
terms 
of 
structuralism
but 
to 
suggest 
that 
this 
was 
its 
only 
significant 
intellectual 
context 
is 
misleading
EOS
if 
his 
work 
needs 
to 
be 
considered 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
contemporary 
politics 
of 
the 
communist 
party
as 
several 
commentators 
have 
stressed
it 
also 
requires 
reference 
to 
work 
done 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
sciences
particularly 
that 
of 
gaston 
bachelard 
in 
the 
history 
of 
physics 
and 
chemistry
his 
pupil 
georges 
canguilhem 
in 
the 
life 
sciences
and 
jean 
cavaillÃ¨s 
in 
mathematics
EOS
all 
four
together 
with 
althusser
's 
pupil
michel 
foucault
worked 
within 
an 
epistemological 
tradition 
which 
was 
critical 
of 
the 
positivism 
which
up 
to 
that 
time
had 
dominated 
the 
history 
of 
the 
sciences
EOS
to 
represent 
althusser
's 
work 
purely 
as 
a 
structural 
marxism
therefore 
passes 
over 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
were 
distinct 
intellectual 
traditions 
in 
france 
whose 
difference 
was 
particularly 
pronounced 
in 
their 
respective 
philosophies 
of 
history
EOS
much 
of 
what 
has 
been 
considered 
to 
be 
poststructuralism
's 
wild 
disregard 
for 
history 
can 
be 
accounted 
for 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
was 
operating 
within 
this 
largely 
unknown 
outside 
france 
anti-empiricist 
and 
anti-positivist 
tradition
EOS
in 
1978 
foucault 
suggested 
that 
post-war 
french 
philosophy 
divides 
according 
to 
a 
line 
which 
separates 
a 
philosophy 
of 
experience
meaning 
and 
the 
subject 
from 
a 
philosophy 
of 
savoir 
rationality 
and 
the 
concept
in 
other 
words
sartre 
and 
merleau-ponty
against 
cavaillÃ¨s
bachelard 
and 
canguilhem
or 
the 
return-to-hegel 
of 
kojÃ¨ve 
in 
the 
thirties
versus 
the 
return-to-rant 
initiated 
in 
the 
philosophy 
of 
the 
sciences 
by 
lÃ©on 
brunschvicg 
in 
the 
late 
nineteenth 
century
EOS
long 
before 
sartre 
developed 
his 
own 
form 
of 
marxist-hegelian 
history
bachelard 
had 
been 
working 
in 
a 
critical 
relation 
to 
hegelian 
historicism
EOS
what 
was 
new 
in 
althusser 
was 
that 
for 
the 
first 
time 
this 
epistemological 
tradition 
was 
developed 
for 
a 
marxism
EOS
against 
sartre
's 
claim 
to 
establish 
marxism
's 
truth 
philosophically
althusser 
reasoned 
that 
if 
marxism 
is 
a 
science
then 
the 
history 
of 
marxism 
ought 
to 
conform 
to 
the 
kind 
of 
history 
that 
had 
been 
developed 
for 
the 
sciences
EOS
the 
question 
then 
simply 
became 
whether 
it 
did 
or 
not
EOS
or 
so 
it 
seemed
EOS
the 
difficulties 
in 
which 
althusser 
subsequently 
became 
enmeshed 
were 
the 
result 
of 
his 
ignoring 
canguilhem
's 
warning 
that 
although 
the 
history 
of 
science 
takes 
science 
for 
its 
object
it 
is 
not 
itself 
a 
science
and 
therefore 
can
not 
claim 
to 
be 
value-free 
or
in 
marxist 
terms
non-ideological
EOS
as 
gregory 
elliott 
has 
recently 
emphasized
although 
althusser 
always 
presented 
himself 
as 
the 
figure 
of 
the 
rigours 
of 
orthodoxy 
against 
the 
eclecticism 
of 
the 
existentialists
in 
his 
own 
work 
he 
was 
just 
as 
catholic
allying 
marxism 
with 
non-marxist 
philosophy
even 
if 
it 
was 
a 
history 
of 
science 
to 
which
he 
claimed
french 
philosophy 
owes 
its 
renaissance 
in 
the 
last 
thirty 
years

ii 
bachelard 
and 
the 
history 
of 
science
EOS
against 
the 
hegelian 
synthesis 
of 
all 
kinds 
of 
history 
within 
the 
same 
developmental 
schema
bachelard 
argued 
that 
the 
history 
of 
science 
can
not 
be 
assimilated 
into 
the 
progressive 
evolutionary 
form 
commonly 
ascribed 
to 
other 
kinds 
of 
human 
history
and 
nor 
can 
it 
be 
mapped 
on 
a 
one-to-one 
basis 
against 
the 
history 
of 
its 
age
EOS
in 
certain 
pure 
sciences
mathematics 
for 
instance
although 
discoveries 
may 
enable 
changes 
and 
developments 
of 
a 
material 
kind
their 
occurrence 
can
not 
ipso 
facto 
be 
explained 
by 
being 
related 
to 
the 
allegedly 
determining 
political 
and 
economic 
history 
of 
their 
immediate 
era
EOS
as 
levi-strauss 
was 
to 
argue
different 
histories 
have 
different 
temporalities
the 
time 
scales 
of 
the 
sciences 
do 
not 
work 
at 
the 
same 
pace 
as 
other 
forms 
of 
history
they 
have 
their 
own 
dynamic
their 
own 
rhythm
their 
own 
times
sometimes 
fast
sometimes 
slow
that 
do 
not 
operate 
by 
the 
ordinary 
round 
of 
the 
year
bachelard 
was 
fond 
of 
pointing 
out 
that 
from 
a 
scientific 
point 
of 
view 
the 
ten 
years 
from 
1920 
to 
1930 
were 
as 
long 
an 
era 
as 
the 
previous 
five 
hundred
EOS
this 
unevenness 
of 
development 
means 
that 
there 
can 
be 
no 
general 
history 
of 
science 
as 
such
it 
is 
uneven 
but 
it 
can
not 
be 
combined
EOS
many 
sciences 
moreover 
share 
the 
characteristic 
that 
a 
major 
discovery 
means 
that 
all 
other 
models 
and 
theories 
are 
simply 
out 
of 
date 
and 
have 
to 
be 
discarded
EOS
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
present
the 
past 
has 
to 
be 
excised
EOS
contemporary 
science 
is 
able 
to 
designate 
itself
through 
its 
revolutionary 
discoveries
as 
a 
liquidation 
of 
a 
past 
EOS
here 
discoveries 
are 
exhibited 
which 
send 
back 
all 
recent 
history 
to 
the 
level 
of 
a 
prehistory
EOS
here 
we 
do 
indeed 
find 
an 
example 
of 
a 
liquidation
of 
history 
which
it 
will 
be 
recalled
is 
exactly 
the 
accusation 
that 
terry 
eagleton 
makes 
against 
poststructuralism
but 
the 
actual 
example 
in 
bachelard 
demonstrates 
how 
much 
more 
complex 
the 
issue 
turns 
out 
to 
be
EOS
science
's 
negative 
relation 
to 
the 
past 
emerges 
as 
one 
of 
its 
most 
distinctive 
and 
significant 
aspects
one 
which 
marks 
a 
complete 
break 
with 
the 
cumulative 
structures 
of 
the 
arts 
and 
social 
sciences
EOS
it 
means
in 
particular
that 
the 
temporality 
of 
science 
can
not 
be 
accommodated 
to 
the 
rhythms 
of 
traditional 
historiography
which 
has 
not
however
prevented 
positivistic 
historians 
of 
science 
from 
writing 
its 
history 
solely 
in 
terms 
of 
precursors 
and 
anachronistic 
anticipations 
of 
modern 
ideas 
in 
early 
thinkers
as 
if 
science 
unrolled 
smoothly 
and 
inevitably 
from 
year 
to 
year
EOS
the 
problem 
with 
this 
approach 
is 
that 
it 
overestimates 
the 
extent 
of 
narrative 
continuity 
in 
the 
history 
of 
science 
which
according 
to 
bachelard
's 
examples
works 
rather 
by 
sudden 
disruptions
discontinuities
and 
entire 
reorganizations 
of 
its 
principles
EOS
science 
is 
forever 
remaking 
its 
own 
history
EOS
as 
early 
as 
1934 
bachelard 
had 
argued 
that 
the 
revolutionary 
changes 
in 
physics
such 
as 
relativity 
theory 
and 
microphysics
meant 
that 
science 
itself 
was 
currently 
defined 
by 
its 
reaction 
against 
the 
past
and 
had 
become 
a 
philosophy 
of 
the 
non
non-cartesian
non-euclidean
non-newtonian
and 
non-baconian
EOS
these 
major 
transformations 
can
not 
be 
mapped 
onto 
the 
model 
of 
a 
continuous 
history
for 
its 
stress 
on 
putative 
anticipations 
fails 
to 
account 
for 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
whole 
form 
of 
knowledge 
can 
be 
transformed 
and 
a 
new 
understanding 
created
EOS
bachelard
's 
work 
on 
the 
formation 
of 
scientific 
disciplines 
led 
him 
to 
argue 
that 
the 
proper 
form 
of 
historical 
analysis 
should 
focus 
not 
upon 
an 
empirical 
history 
but 
upon 
the 
cognitive 
or 
epistemological 
status 
of 
concepts 
that 
distinguish 
a 
new 
science 
from 
an 
old 
one
EOS
those 
concepts 
have 
not 
evolved 
from 
the 
old 
ones
for 
it 
is 
precisely 
their 
radical 
difference 
that 
constitutes 
the 
new 
science
the 
new 
positivity
produced 
by 
what 
he 
termed 
an 
epistemological 
rupture
EOS
bachelard 
himself 
preferred 
to 
give 
examples 
of 
such 
ruptures 
rather 
than 
theorize 
how 
they 
took 
place
EOS
althusserians 
subsequently 
placed 
much 
emphasis 
upon 
the 
epistemological 
break
and 
were 
in 
turn 
castigated 
for 
being 
unable 
to 
explain 
how 
it 
occurred
EOS
but 
this 
neglects 
the 
force 
of 
althusser
's 
emphasis 
on 
marxism 
as 
itself 
a 
theoretical 
practice 
with 
its 
own 
history 
of 
epistemological 
self-correction
a 
possibility 
derived 
from 
the 
work 
of 
the 
mathematician 
jean 
cavaillÃ¨s
who 
stressed 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
the 
history 
of 
mathematics
particularly 
set 
theory
could 
be 
accounted 
for 
by 
the 
dialectical 
development 
of 
the 
concept
EOS
much 
of 
the 
emphasis 
on 
set 
theory 
in 
lacan 
and 
others
as 
well 
as 
the 
similarity 
of 
certain 
of 
their 
ideas 
to 
those 
of 
gÃ¶del
whose 
work 
cavaillÃ¨s 
utilizes
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
his 
influence
indeed 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
argue 
that 
the 
whole 
emphasis 
in 
post-war 
french 
thinkers 
on 
a 
non-contradictory 
heterogeneity 
in 
which 
incompatible 
or 
incommensurable 
elements 
are 
juxtaposed 
against 
or 
as 
part 
of 
each 
other 
is  
derived 
as 
much 
from 
set 
theory 
as 
from 
freud
EOS
cavaillÃ¨s 
developed 
these 
ideas 
into 
a 
theory 
of 
science 
as 
such
which
he 
argued
changed 
not 
through 
empirical 
discovery 
but 
through 
the 
theoretical 
reworking 
of 
its 
own 
concepts 
in 
the 
pure
sciences
EOS
this 
view
whereby 
science 
progresses 
through 
the 
dialectic 
of 
its 
concepts 
rather 
than 
by 
testing 
its 
hypotheses 
against 
experience
was 
developed 
significantly 
by 
both 
bachelard 
and 
althusser
EOS
if 
it 
enabled 
the 
latter 
the 
crucial 
theoretical 
move 
of 
being 
able 
to 
reject 
the 
classical 
empiricist 
conception 
of 
knowledge
it 
was 
also 
to 
put 
him 
in 
the 
position 
of 
even 
castigating 
as 
historicist
any 
attempts 
to 
account 
for 
theoretical 
discourse 
in 
terms 
of 
its 
historical 
conditions 
of 
production 
perhaps 
one 
of 
the 
major 
ways 
in 
which 
he 
differed 
from 
canguilhem 
and 
foucault
EOS
bachelard 
and 
cavaillÃ¨s 
agree 
that 
the 
distinguishing 
characteristic 
of 
modern 
science 
is 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
it 
has 
become 
separated 
from 
common-sense 
knowledge 
so 
that 
consciousness 
and 
its 
concepts 
are 
now 
opposed
EOS
the 
break 
between 
ordinary 
and 
scientific 
knowledge 
seems 
to 
us 
so 
clear 
that 
these 
two 
types 
of 
knowledge 
could 
not 
have 
the 
same 
philosophy
EOS
empiricism 
is 
the 
philosophy 
which 
corresponds 
to 
ordinary 
knowledge
EOS
there 
empiricism 
finds 
its 
origin
its 
evidence
its 
development
EOS
by 
contrast
scientific 
knowledge 
is 
bound 
up 
with 
rationalism 
and
whether 
one 
wishes 
it 
or 
not
rationalism 
is 
allied 
to 
science
and 
demands 
scientific 
goals
EOS
the 
use 
of 
scientific 
instruments 
in 
particular 
means 
that 
scientific 
perception 
is 
constantly 
at 
odds 
with 
the 
experience 
of 
everyday 
perception
EOS
because 
scientificity 
is 
achieved 
through 
a 
break 
with 
common-sense 
forms 
of 
thinking
termed 
epistemological 
obstacles
bachelard
like 
lÃ©vi-strauss 
and 
althusser 
after 
him
argues 
that 
any 
philosophy 
such 
as 
existentialism 
that 
is 
founded 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
knowing 
subject 
is 
bound 
to 
involve 
illusory 
or 
ideological 
forms 
of 
thought
EOS
for 
this 
reason
bachelard 
refers 
ironically 
to 
sartre
's 
phenomenology 
as 
a 
belated 
form 
of 
alchemy
EOS
but 
if 
the 
new 
science 
is 
produced 
through 
a 
rupture 
with 
the 
errors
of 
the 
old
the 
tenacious 
hold 
of 
common-sense 
forms 
of 
thought 
means 
that 
any 
given 
text 
may 
simultaneously 
embody 
aspects 
of 
the 
old 
and 
new 
ways 
of 
thinking
theoretical 
and 
ideological 
frameworks 
that 
bachelard
and 
althusser 
after 
him
term 
problematics
EOS
instead 
of 
the 
parade 
of 
universal 
doubt
scientific 
research 
requires 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
problematic 
EOS
it 
takes 
its 
real 
departure 
from 
a 
problem 
even 
if 
it 
is 
badly 
set 
up
EOS
the 
scientific 
i 
is 
then 
a 
programme 
of 
experiments 
whereas 
the 
non-scientific 
i 
is 
already 
a 
constituted 
problematic 
EOS
bachelard 
tries 
to 
think 
through 
the 
problem 
of 
how 
epistemological 
obstacles 
operated 
both 
before 
and 
after 
scientificity
EOS
in 
particular
he 
suggests 
that 
the 
educational 
system 
has 
a 
marked 
effect 
on 
the 
production 
and 
reproduction 
of 
scientific 
knowledge
and 
criticizes 
it 
for 
the 
ahistorical 
way 
in 
which 
it 
teaches 
scientific 
problems
theories
experiments 
and 
proofs
EOS
while 
pedagogy 
continues 
the 
myth 
of 
an 
elementary 
or 
easy 
science
language 
itself 
can 
also 
produce 
difficulties
EOS
the 
nomenclature 
of 
science 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
definitive 
concepts
EOS
it 
is 
ceaselessly 
adjusted
completed
varied
EOS
the 
language 
of 
science 
is 
in 
a 
state 
of 
permanent 
semantic 
revolution
EOS
obstacles 
such 
as 
these 
lead 
bachelard 
to 
formulate 
a 
theory 
of 
material 
psychoanalysis
which 
offers 
a 
psychoanalysis 
of 
objective 
knowledge
to 
account 
for 
and 
think 
through 
the 
problem 
of 
epistemological 
obstacles
EOS
it 
is 
also 
supposed 
to 
have 
a 
therapeutic 
effect 
of 
a 
brutal
surgical
separation 
of 
unconscious 
and 
rational 
convictions 
in 
order
to 
cure 
us 
of 
our 
images 
or 
at 
least 
to 
limit 
their 
power
EOS
this 
separation 
between 
scientific 
and 
common-sense 
knowledge 
in 
turn 
produces 
a 
significant 
effect 
on 
bachelard
's 
thinking 
about 
history
EOS
for
as 
lecourt 
describes 
it
he 
attempts
EOS
to 
elaborate 
a 
system 
of 
concepts 
which 
will 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
think 
the 
intrication 
of 
two 
histories 
that 
of 
the 
scientific 
and 
the 
non-scientific 
in 
the 
practice 
of 
the 
scientists
EOS
hence 
this 
project 
culminates 
in 
le 
rationalisme 
appliquÃ© 
with 
the 
project 
of 
an 
epistemological 
history 
which 
is 
presented 
as 
a 
dual 
history
a 
ratified 
history
or 
history 
of 
the 
scientific 
in 
scientific 
practice
and 
a 
lapsed 
history
or 
history 
of 
the 
interventions 
of 
the 
non-scientific 
in 
scientific 
practice
EOS
this 
means 
that 
science 
can 
have 
two 
histories
which 
constantly 
intertwine 
but 
never 
resolve
with 
one 
evaluated 
as 
positive
the 
other 
as 
negative 
and 
therefore 
silently 
suppressed 
even 
though 
it 
may 
remain 
determining
EOS
instead 
of 
upholding 
one 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
other
bachelard 
offers 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
deconstructive 
history 
which 
would 
reinscribe 
that 
which 
had 
been 
excluded
this 
could 
also 
enable 
a 
differential 
history 
of 
science 
and 
ideology
accounting 
for 
the 
perpetuation 
of 
ideology 
after 
the 
production 
of 
science
EOS
to 
do 
so
bachelard
as 
althusser 
was 
to 
do 
later
invokes 
the 
use 
of 
psychoanalysis 
for 
the 
study 
of 
history 
and 
ideology
EOS
the 
notion 
of 
the 
epistemological 
break
while 
offering 
a 
theory 
of 
scientificity
and 
even 
of 
ideology
implied 
a 
very 
different 
view 
of 
history 
from 
that 
of 
sartre
EOS
in 
some 
sense
it 
went 
to 
the

was

lecourt 
has 
pointed 
to 
the

enable 
him 
to 
think 
together 
several

with 
different

in 
short
the 
concept 
of 
a 
differential 
history
EOS
such 
a 
general 
concept 
was 
to 
be 
provided 
by 
althusser
's 
theory 
of 
relative 
autonomy 
within 
a

in

althusser 
and 
the

althusser
's 
rereading 
of 
marx 
can 
thus 
be 
as 
usefully 
considered 
in 
the 
context 
of 
theories 
of 
the 
history 
of 
science 
as 
of 
structuralism
a 
certain 
conflation 
between 
the 
two 
has 
been 
possible 
because 
both 
were 
opposed 
to 
humanistic 
and 
phenomenological 
theories 
of 
knowledge 
in 
general 
and 
to 
historicism 
in 
particular
EOS
within 
the 
general 
framework 
of 
his 
attack 
on 
the 
humanistic 
hegelian 
tradition 
of 
western 
marxism
althusser
's 
specific 
objection 
to 
sartre
's 
attempt 
to 
mediate 
marxism 
with 
existential 
subjectivity 
was 
that 
such 
a 
move 
went 
against 
the 
crucial 
discoveries 
which 
had 
founded 
marxism 
in 
the 
first 
place
in 
an 
extension 
of 
lÃ©vi-strauss
' 
argument
he 
maintained 
that 
the 
notion 
of 
man
that 
sartre 
used 
was 
derived 
from 
a 
particular 
ideological 
definition 
of 
the 
human 
subject 
which 
represses 
marx
's 
insight 
that 
the 
human 
subject 
is 
not 
the 
centre 
of 
history
together 
with 
freud
's 
that 
the 
subject 
is 
not 
centred 
in 
consciousness
EOS
for 
althusser 
both 
history 
and 
the 
subject 
are 
equally 
decentred
his 
attack 
on 
sartre
's 
claims 
for 
a 
unitary 
history 
however 
complex 
its 
textual 
elaboration 
may 
have 
proved 
to 
be
was 
therefore 
accompanied 
by 
a 
critique 
of 
the 
notion 
of 
the 
unitary 
human 
subject 
that 
constitutes 
it
EOS
one 
way 
of 
characterizing 
althusser
's 
intervention 
would 
be 
martin 
jay
's 
observation 
that 
he 
effectively 
destroyed 
the 
lukÃ¡csian 
notion 
of 
totality
EOS
another 
would 
be 
to 
say 
he 
attempted 
to 
theorize 
the 
very 
position 
that 
sartre 
had 
fought 
to 
get 
out 
of
EOS
if 
sartre
's 
argument 
depended 
on 
a 
logic 
of 
history 
as 
totalization 
but 
broke 
down 
when 
he 
could 
not 
combine 
the 
praxis 
of 
the 
individual 
with 
the 
general 
logic 
of 
totalization 
without 
a 
totalizer
except 
through 
the 
proliferation 
of 
his 
own 
writing
althusser
by 
contrast
exploited 
the 
possibility 
of 
history 
as 
a 
process 
without 
a 
subject
a 
history 
characterized 
by 
radical 
breaks 
and 
discontinuities
distinct 
from 
each 
other 
and 
not 
totalizing
EOS
it 
was 
this 
aspect 
of 
althusserian 
theory
perhaps 
more 
than 
any 
other
that 
led 
many 
orthodox 
marxists 
to 
consider 
that 
althusser 
was 
not 
really 
a 
marxist 
at 
all
EOS
the 
accusation 
that 
poststructuralism 
neglects 
history 
undoubtedly 
harks 
back 
above 
all 
to 
the 
work 
of 
althusser 
who
more 
than 
anyone 
else
appears 
to 
have 
attempted 
to 
eliminate 
history
EOS
notwithstanding 
their 
philosophical 
and 
political 
differences
there 
are 
nevertheless 
certain 
similarities 
between 
althusser
's 
and 
sartre
's 
projects 
when 
viewed 
in 
relation 
to 
orthodox 
marxism
EOS
althusser 
shared 
sartre
's 
opposition 
to 
stalinism
's 
emphasis 
on 
economism 
and 
technical  
determinism
dissociating 
himself 
from 
it 
not 
through 
an 
assertion 
of 
individual 
agency 
but 
through 
a 
reformulation 
of 
the 
marxist 
thesis 
of 
determination 
by 
economic 
relations 
redefined 
as 
a 
causal 
rather 
than 
a 
historical 
relation
EOS
at 
the 
same 
time 
althusser 
argued 
that 
sartre 
had 
not 
isolated 
the 
central 
problems 
of 
orthodox 
marxist 
theory
and 
as 
a 
result 
continued 
to 
work 
with 
some 
of 
its 
more 
questionable 
preconceptions
EOS
in 
particular
in 
spite 
of 
his 
attempt 
to 
avoid 
positing 
history 
as 
an 
a 
priori 
transcendent 
law
in 
the 
published 
first 
volume 
of 
the 
critique 
he 
had 
still 
utilized 
an 
organicist 
teleological 
model 
of 
history 
which 
assumes 
that 
the 
end 
is 
already 
implicit 
in 
the 
beginning
and 
that 
history 
rolls 
forward 
to 
a 
determined 
end
EOS
both 
stalinism 
and 
sartreanism 
assume 
that 
history 
is 
an 
emancipatory 
process 
of 
self-realization
even 
if 
the 
forces 
of 
production 
in 
the 
one 
are 
replaced 
by 
the 
praxis 
of 
the 
self-conscious 
human 
subject 
in 
the 
other
EOS
althusser 
termed 
such 
a 
view 
historicism
an 
abstract 
philosophical 
scheme 
that 
imposes 
an 
overall 
process 
of 
transformation 
upon 
historical 
events
EOS
at 
first 
glance
it 
might 
seem 
as 
if 
althusser 
himself 
gave 
up 
history 
and 
tried 
science 
instead
EOS
like 
sartre
he 
sought 
to 
constitute 
marxism 
as 
a 
form 
of 
truth
but 
attempted 
to 
prove 
its 
truth 
not 
through 
the 
dialectic 
of 
history 
but 
rather 
as 
a 
science
authenticating 
marx
's 
immense 
theoretical 
revolution
epistemologically 
through 
a 
demonstration 
of 
its 
scientificity
EOS
in 
order 
to 
claim 
a 
scientific 
status 
for 
marxism 
as 
knowledge 
rather 
than 
ideology
or 
non-knowledge
althusser 
invoked 
bachelard
's 
historical 
epistemology 
which 
allowed 
him 
to 
posit 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
radical 
discontinuity 
between 
the 
two
with 
marxist 
science 
separated 
from 
earlier 
forms 
of 
non-knowledge 
in 
marx
's 
texts 
by 
an 
epistemological 
break
EOS
this 
necessarily 
meant 
that 
althusser 
endorsed 
bachelard
's 
arguments 
about 
empiricism 
and 
rejected 
the 
concept 
of 
history 
as 
a 
system 
of 
progression 
or 
evolution
EOS
however 
althusser 
found 
it 
difficult 
to 
maintain 
a 
marxist 
theory 
of 
history 
while 
avoiding 
its 
customary 
hegelian 
form
EOS
his 
basic 
argument
that 
marx 
proposed 
a 
new 
conception 
of 
knowledge 
defined 
against 
hegelianism
implied 
an 
accompanying 
revision 
of 
the 
hegelian 
concept 
of 
history
which
as 
we 
have 
seen 
in 
the 
cases 
of 
lukÃ¡cs 
and 
sartre
had 
hitherto 
provided 
the 
dominant 
model 
of 
marxist 
historicism
EOS
althusser
's 
theory 
of 
history 
has 
been 
more 
widely 
attacked 
and 
denigrated 
than 
any 
other 
aspect 
of 
his 
work
largely 
because 
he 
dared 
to 
argue 
that
far 
from 
providing 
the 
unassailable 
foundation 
of 
marxism
history 
was 
a 
problematic 
concept 
even 
in 
marx
's 
own 
texts
EOS
this 
apparently 
full 
word 
is 
in 
fact 
theoretically 
an 
empty 
word
in 
the 
immediacy 
of 
its 
obviousness 
or 
rather
it 
is 
the 
ideology-fulfilment 
which 
surfaces 
in 
this 
lapse 
of 
rigour
EOS
anyone 
who 
reads 
capital 
without 
posing 
the 
critical 
question 
of 
its 
object 
sees 
no 
malice 
in 
this 
word 
that 
speaks
to 
him
he 
happily 
continues 
the 
discourse 
whose 
first 
word 
this 
word 
may 
be
the 
ideological 
discourse 
of 
history
and 
then 
the 
historicist  
discourse
EOS
as 
we 
have 
seen 
and 
as 
we 
understand
the 
theoretical 
and 
practical 
consequences 
are 
not 
so 
innocent
EOS

EOS
althusser 
argues 
that 
marx
's 
intervention 
did 
not 
merely 
amount 
to 
the 
historicization 
of 
the 
formal 
categories 
of 
the 
classical 
economists
EOS
if

was 
the 
case

marxists 
often 
imply 
that 
marxism 
simply 
involves 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
historical 
framework 
always 
historicize
but 
this 
assumption 
can 
only 
be 
made
according 
to 
althusser
because 
of
the 
confusion 
that 
surrounds 
the 
concept 
of 
history 
EOS
in 
reality
it 
is 
to 
introduce 
as 
a 
solution 
a 
concept 
which 
itself 
poses 
a 
theoretical 
problem
for 
as 
it 
is 
adopted 
and 
understood 
it 
is 
an 
uncriticized 
concept
a 
concept 
which
like 
all 
obvious
concepts
threatens 
to 
have 
for 
theoretical 
content 
no 
more 
than 
the 
function 
that 
the 
existing 
or 
dominant 
ideology 
defines 
for 
it
EOS
it 
is 
to 
introduce 
as 
a 
theoretical 
solution 
a 
concept 
whose 
status 
has 
not 
been 
examined
and 
which
far 
from 
being 
a 
solution
is 
in 
reality 
a 
theoretical 
problem
EOS

EOS
historicism 
presumes 
that 
a 
concept 
of 
history 
can 
be 
borrowed 
for 
marxism 
from 
hegel 
or 
from 
the 
practice 
of 
empiricist 
historians 
without 
difficulty 
and 
without 
asking 
how 
such 
a 
concept 
is 
specific 
to 
marxism
for 
althusser 
the 
crucial 
question 
is 
to 
ask 
what 
must 
be 
the 
content 
of 
the 
concept 
of 
history 
imposed 
by 
marx
's 
theoretical 
problematic
EOS
that 
problematic 
can
not 
be 
identical 
to 
hegel
's 
because 
both 
hegel 
and 
marx 
define 
historical 
time 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
social 
totality
insofar 
as 
their 
definitions 
of 
the 
social 
totality 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
differ
so 
also 
will 
their 
concepts 
of 
historical 
time
EOS
for 
flegel 
historical 
time 
is 
merely 
the 
reflection 
in 
the 
continuity 
of 
time 
of 
the 
internal 
essence 
of 
the 
historical 
totality 
incarnating 
a 
moment 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
concept
93
EOS
historical 
time 
is 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
social 
totality 
and 
will 
therefore 
indicate 
its 
structure
EOS
althusser 
isolates 
two 
key 
characteristics 
of 
hegelian 
historical 
time
its 
homogeneous 
continuity 
and 
its 
contemporaneity
EOS
the 
first 
is 
well 
known
here 
time 
is 
the 
continuum 
in 
which 
the 
dialectical 
continuity 
of 
the 
process 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
idea 
is 
manifest
94
EOS
in 
this 
schema 
the 
science 
of 
history 
consists 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
division 
of 
this 
continuum 
into 
the 
periods 
that 
constitute 
successive 
dialectical 
totalities
EOS
the 
second 
characteristic
the 
contemporaneity 
of 
historical 
time
that 
is
the 
category 
of 
the 
historical 
present
is 
more 
complex 
but 
an 
essential 
element 
in 
the 
whole 
hegelian 
model 
of 
history
indeed 
is 
its 
condition 
of 
possibility
EOS
if 
historical 
time 
is 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
social 
totality 
then 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
two 
must 
be 
one 
of 
immediacy
allowing 
what 
althusser 
calls 
an 
essential 
section
that 
is 
a 
break 
in 
the 
present 
such 
that 
all 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
whole 
revealed 
by 
this 
section 
are 
in 
an 
immediate 
relationship 
with 
one 
another
a 
relationship 
that 
immediately 
expresses 
their 
internal 
essence
EOS
this 
section 
is 
possible 
precisely 
because 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
whole 
is 
an 
expressive 
totality
that 
is 
a 
totality 
all 
of 
whose 
parts 
are 
so 
many 
total 
parts 
each 
expressing 
the 
others
and 
each 
expressing 
the 
social 
totality 
that 
contains 
them
because 
each 
in 
itself 
contains 
in 
the 
immediate 
form 
of 
its 
expression 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
totality 
itself
94
EOS
hegel
's 
conception 
of 
historical 
time
then
reflects 
his 
conception 
of 
the 
intrinsic 
unity 
between 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
social 
totality
each 
a 
part 
of 
the 
whole 
and 
the 
whole 
present 
in 
each 
part
so 
that 
history 
too 
partakes 
of 
a 
self-reflective 
immediacy 
which 
paradoxically 
makes 
it 
ahistorical
EOS
perhaps 
surprisingly
given 
his 
alleged 
structuralism
althusser 
argues 
that 
the 
structuralist 
distinction 
between 
synchrony 
and 
diachrony 
rests 
upon 
this 
hegelian 
version 
of 
historical 
time 
which 
is 
both 
continuous 
and 
contemporaneous 
with 
itself
EOS
against 
this 
althusser 
maintains 
that 
time
even 
chronological 
time
is 
not 
just 
an 
empirical 
entity
but 
a 
concept
that 
though 
history 
may 
be 
articulated 
in 
general 
with 
chronological 
time
each 
history 
has 
its 
own 
temporality
which 
can 
only 
be 
found 
by 
establishing 
the 
conceptual 
nexus 
of 
the 
history 
in 
question
EOS
in 
order 
to 
determine 
what 
an 
event 
is
we 
must 
know 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
history 
in 
which 
the 
event 
is 
to 
occur
EOS
for 
example
in 
order 
to 
understand 
the 
history 
of 
physics
we 
have 
to 
know 
the 
concept 
or 
problematic 
of 
physics 
in 
order 
to 
establish 
what 
an 
event 
in 
physics 
consists 
of
EOS
of 
course 
a 
chronological 
narrative 
can 
be 
constructed
but 
the 
history 
of 
physics 
in 
fact 
has 
its 
own 
temporality 
in 
which 
the 
first 
event 
after 
aristotle 
was 
newton
the 
second 
was 
einstein
the 
third 
black 
holes
etc
EOS
now 
this 
specific 
temporality 
will 
have 
no 
homogeneous 
relation 
to
say
the 
history 
of 
literature
EOS
however
it 
can 
be 
articulated 
with 
other 
histories
indeed 
is 
articulated
according 
to 
the 
overall 
but 
decentred 
totality 
of 
the 
particular 
mode 
of 
production
EOS
sometimes 
althusser 
seems 
to 
imply 
that 
different 
histories 
may 
range 
through 
different 
modes 
of 
production
at 
other 
times 
it 
appears 
that 
they 
are 
specific 
to 
each
an 
effect 
of 
the 
overdetermination 
of 
the 
social 
formation
EOS
but 
in 
either 
case
unlike 
the 
hegelian 
essential 
section
where 
each 
event 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
be 
in 
an 
essential 
articulation 
with 
the 
whole 
in 
a 
continuous 
and 
homogeneous 
spatio-temporality
a 
cross-section 
at 
any 
particular 
moment 
will 
show 
a 
heterogeneous 
array 
of 
presences 
and 
absences
EOS
althusser 
elaborates 
his 
thesis 
that 
marxism 
is 
not 
a 
historicism 
at 
some 
length
presenting 
a 
critique 
of 
the 
historicist 
and 
humanist 
traditions 
which 
he 
takes 
back 
from 
sartre 
to 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
century
even 
to 
the 
russian 
revolution 
itself
and 
in 
which 
he 
also 
includes 
the 
absolute 
historicism
of 
gramsci 
and 
the 
frankfurt 
school
EOS
above 
all
he 
criticizes 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
hegel 
reduces 
the 
diverse 
historical 
totality 
of 
a 
society 
to 
a 
single

so 
that 
history 
occurs 
only 
through 
the 
principle 
of 
contradiction 
in 
the 
dialectic
EOS
for 
althusser
the 
apparently 
simple 
contradiction 
is 
always 
overdetermined
the 
inversion 
of 
hegel
's 
single 
principle 
to 
a 
dialectic 
generating 
successive

amounts 
to 
economism
EOS
this 
objection 
holds 
equally 
for 
sartre
's 
hegelian 
historicism
the 
effect 
of

to 
reduce 
the

sartre
's 
historicism 
shares 
the 
common 
tendency 
of 
all 
historicist 
interpretations 
of 
marxism 
which 
transform 
the 
marxist 
totality 
into 
a 
variant 
of 
the 
hegelian 
totality
they 
all 
share 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
contemporaneity 
of 
a 
temporal 
presence 
and 
continuity 
which 
allows 
the 
possibility 
of 
an 
essential 
section
EOS
paradoxically 
therefore
althusser 
argues
humanist 
marxism 
shares 
the 
same 
basic 
theoretical 
principles 
with 
the 
orthodox 
economist 
marxism 
of 
the 
second 
international 
which 
politically 
it 
was 
its 
aim 
to 
oppose

whether 
passive

active
fatalist

voluntarist
both 
reduce 
marxist 
analysis 
to 
a 
single 
theoretical 
problematic
EOS
all 
that

happened

that 
the

althusser
's

has 
been 
to 
show 
that
within

notion 
of 
history 
that 
seemed 
as 
if 
it 
could 
be 
invoked 
on 
its 
own 
as 
self-evident
there 
rests 
an 
entire 
presupposition 
about 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
social 
whole 
that 
is 
not 
derived 
from 
marxist 
theory
EOS
the 
marxist 
concept

instead
he

be 
thought 
through 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
marxist 
conception 
of 
the 
social 
totality
97
EOS
that 
marxist 
conception 
is
of 
course
the 
althusserian 
one
in 
althusser
's 
reading 
of 
marx 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
whole 
is 
precisely 
not 
that 
of 
the 
hegelian 
and 
sartrean 
expressive 
totality
rather 
it 
is 
constituted 
through 
overdetermination
through
EOS
a 
certain 
type 
of 
complexity 
the 
unity 
of 
a 
structured 
whole 
containing 
what 
can 
be 
called 
levels 
or 
instances 
which 
are 
distinct 
and 
relatively 
autonomous
and 
coexist 
within 
this 
complex 
structural

articulated

another 
according

the 
hegelian 
model 
of 
the 
coexistence 
of

which 
allows 
the 
possibility 
of 
the

section
is 
incompatible 
with 
this 
description
but 
althusser 
continues 
to 
assume 
nevertheless 
that 
there 
is 
a 
totality 
and 
that 
it 
has 
the 
structure 
of 
an 
organic 
hierarchised 
whole 
98
EOS
this

EOS
this 
last 
description 
is 
often 
misunderstood
the 
point 
is 
that 
the 
economic 
is 
never 
a 
simple 
causal 
function 
that 
operates 
alone
EOS
the 
economic 
dialectic 
is 
never 
active 
in 
the 
pure

these

never

scatter

the

strides 
along

EOS
the 
significance 
of 
the 
allusion 
to 
freud 
in 
this 
famous 
passage 
is 
to 
suggest 
that 
to 
conceive 
of 
the 
economic 
as 
operating 
in 
isolation 
is 
as 
illusory 
as 
to 
imagine 
that 
the 
ego 
can 
operate 
without 
the 
unconscious
they 
are 
both 
the 
reciprocal 
products 
of 
the 
other
EOS
the 
last 
instance
the 
economic
never 
operates 
in

separate

all 
the 
other

the 
social 
totality
it 
is 
the 
lonely 
hour 
that

comes
EOS
if 
one 
were 
to 
pursue 
the 
analogy 
with 
freud 
rigorously
althusser 
is 
even 
suggesting 
here 
that 
the 
primacy 
of 
the 
economic 
ego
is 
a 
delusion
and 
that 
the 
superstructure 
unconscious
is 
the 
more 
fundamental 
determining 
force
or 
at 
the 
very 
least 
that 
they 
are 
equally 
overdetermined
EOS
whereas 
sartre
's 
totality 
was 
never 
totalized 
because 
it 
was 
always 
still 
in 
process

could 
never 
be 
closed
althusser
's 
totality 
is 
never 
totalizable 
because 
it 
is 
decentred 
and 
displaced 
in 
time
EOS
the 
different 
structured 
levels 
do 
not 
coexist 
in 
a 
temporal 
present 
which 
coincides 
with 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
essence 
with 
its 
phenomena
EOS
this 
means 
that 
the 
model 
of 
continuous 
and 
homogeneous 
time 
which 
lÃ©vi-strauss

also 
argued 
against

not 
here 
be

EOS
this 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
turning 
diachrony

the 
point 
is 
rather 
that
EOS
it 
is 
no

possible

the

the

of 
the

in 
the

historical

EOS
each 
of 
these 
different 
levels
does 
not 
have 
the 
same 
type 
of 
historical 
existence
EOS
on 
the 
contrary
we 
have 
to 
assign 
to 
each

a 
peculiar

relatively

hence 
relatively 
independent
even 
in 
its

EOS
each 
of 
these 
peculiar 
histories 
is 
punctuated 
with 
peculiar 
rhythms 
and 
can 
only 
be 
known 
on 
condition 
that 
we 
have 
defined 
the

EOS
these

their

they

the

they

such

althusser 
therefore 
criticizes 
the

historians 
for 
merely 
arguing 
that  
periodizations 
differ 
for

that

this 
is 
not 
enough
for 
it 
is

these

in

punctuation

in 
their

this

althusser

marx 
did

effected

EOS
much 
of 
the 
effort 
of 
althusserian 
marxism 
was 
taken 
up 
with

a 
theory

it 
was 
the 
failure

the 
main 
reason

subsequent

EOS
althusser
's 
influence 
declined 
in

after 
1968
partly 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
role 
played 
by 
the 
pcf
of 
which 
althusser 
was 
a 
member
in 
the 
events 
of

1968
and 
partly 
as 
an 
effect 
of 
a 
number 
of 
critiques 
of 
his 
work
some 
of 
them 
by 
althusser 
himself
EOS
in

by

althusser
's 
greatest 
impact 
occurred 
in 
the 
decade 
that

from 
the 
late

his 
work 
constituted 
something 
like 
a 
hegemonic 
theory 
in 
dominance
EOS
after 
1978
however
the 
influence 
of 
althusser 
declined 
rapidly 
after 
a 
series 
of 
books 
by 
two 
marxist 
sociologists
barry 
hindess

paul 
hirst
who 
developed 
and 
extended 
the 
implications

those 
critiques 
already 
made 
in 
france
EOS
their 
work 
made 
it 
impossible 
henceforth 
to 
invoke 
the 
work 
of 
althusser 
in 
britain 
without 
reference 
to 
the 
problems 
which 
they 
had 
articulated
EOS
with 
hindess 
and 
hirst 
criticism 
of 
althusser
's 
theory 
of

shifted 
to 
the 
problematic 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
concept 
increasingly 
assimilated 
to 
representation
to 
the 
real
thus 
reducing 
it 
to 
a 
question 
of 
epistemology
EOS
where
though
does 
this 
leave 
the 
concept 
of 
history 
in 
althusser
EOS
does 
it 
have 
its 
own

aside 
from

does 
this 
mean

hirst 
suggests
that 
the 
only 
concept 
of 
history 
must 
in 
fact 
still 
be 
the 
hegelian 
one

teleology

there

it

for 
hirst 
this 
means 
that

be 
no

althusser

the 
other 
hand
we 
would 
add 
that 
the 
lesson 
of 
hegel
's
marx
's
and 
sartre
's 
attempt 
also 
suggests 
that 
history 
can
not 
be 
coherently 
essentialist 
and 
teleological 
either
EOS
hirst
's 
straightforward 
characterization 
of 
althusser
's 
work 
as 
a 
failure
does 
not 
acknowledge 
the 
constant 
tension 
in 
the 
historical 
project 
itself
EOS
if 
sartre
's 
endeavour 
to 
ground 
the 
marxist 
science 
of 
history 
suggests 
that 
the 
hegelian 
totality 
and 
continuum 
can 
only 
work 
by 
a 
continual 
labour 
of 
excluding 
the 
partial 
and 
discontinuous
althusser
's 
effort 
to 
constitute 
a 
differentiated 
history 
shows 
that 
you 
can
not 
do 
it 
without 
a 
teleology
EOS
what 
both 
demonstrate 
is 
that 
any 
history 
as 
such 
has 
to 
think 
both
simultaneously
EOS
as 
long 
as 
history 
is 
assumed 
to 
operate 
according 
to 
the 
protocols 
of 
a 
conventional 
logic
where 
a 
contradiction 
simply 
means 
you 
can
not 
think 
it 
or 
do 
it 
as 
hirst 
supposes
then 
it 
remains 
at 
the 
impasse 
he 
describes
EOS
althusser
's 
significant 
contribution 
was 
to 
problematize 
the 
concept 
of 
history 
by 
addressing 
its 
presuppositions 
about 
temporality 
an 
area 
which 
hindess 
and 
hirst 
altogether 
neglect
EOS
in 
order 
to 
make 
their 
claim 
that 
his 
decentred 
totality 
is 
still 
expressive 
and 
therefore 
essentialist
they 
have 
to 
ignore 
the 
arguments 
about 
temporality 
in 
the 
critique 
of 
the 
hegelian 
essential 
section 
as 
the 
co-existence 
of 
presence
and 
thus 
fail 
to 
do 
justice 
to 
the 
way 
in 
which 
althusser 
constructs
as 
foucault 
puts 
it
a 
counter-memory 
a 
transformation 
of 
history 
into 
a 
totally 
different 
form 
of 
time
EOS
if 
the 
althusserian 
mode 
of 
production 
is 
made 
up 
of 
differential 
times 
and 
histories
a 
complex 
intersection
of 
the 
different 
times
rhythms
turnovers
etc.
then 
each 
element 
can
not 
express 
the 
whole 
because 
the 
whole 
is 
only 
accessible 
as 
a 
concept
which 
is 
precisely 
not 
expressed 
at 
all
EOS
for 
the 
concept
like 
every 
concept
is 
never 
immediately 
given
never 
legible 
in 
visible 
reality
like 
every 
concept 
this 
concept 
must 
be 
produced
constructed
by 
the 
analyst
EOS
this 
formulation 
enabled 
althusser 
to 
theorize 
a 
decentred 
totality 
which 
allowed 
the 
possibility 
of 
differences 
without 
reducing 
each 
instance 
to 
the 
operation 
of 
an 
essence 
or 
a 
single 
principle
such 
as 
the 
dialectic
EOS
if 
his 
notion 
of 
the 
mode 
of 
production 
as 
such 
a 
totality 
could 
not 
be 
sustained 
in 
a 
differential 
relation 
to 
other 
modes 
of 
production 
notions 
of 
residual 
and 
emergent 
forms 
notwithstanding
althusser 
nevertheless 
offered 
a 
particularly 
interesting 
theorization 
of 
the 
problems 
involved 
in 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
historical
articulating 
the 
paradoxical 
conditions 
of 
any 
theorization 
of 
history
EOS
if 
he 
showed 
it 
to 
be 
an 
impossible 
concept
he 
continued 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
it 
remains 
a 
necessary 
one
and 
acknowledged 
that 
we 
must 
learn 
to 
live 
with 
that 
impossibility
EOS
how 
does 
this 
take 
place
EOS
it 
is 
at 
this 
point 
that 
the 
subject 
of 
history 
re-enters
history 
may 
be 
a 
process 
without 
one
but 
the 
subject 
is 
nevertheless 
inscribed 
within 
history
EOS
once 
again
as 
for 
sartre
the 
subject 
operates 
at 
the 
pivot 
of 
the 
paradox
EOS
for 
the 
subject 
does 
not 
understand 
history 
according 
to 
its 
scientific 
formulation
but 
undergoes 
the 
process 
of 
inter-pellation 
at 
the 
level 
of 
ideology
and 
thus 
experiences 
it 
through 
the 
formulas 
of 
historicism
EOS
history
which 
can 
now 
no 
longer 
be 
considered 
a 
concept 
as 
such
is 
therefore 
made 
up 
of 
the 
incommensurable 
relation 
between 
these 
two 
disjunctive 
set-ups
EOS
it 
therefore 
operates 
for 
althusser 
both 
at 
the 
level 
of 
science 
and 
of 
ideology
not 
in 
terms 
of 
truth 
to 
falsity
but 
as 
an 
irresolvable 
dialectic 
between 
the 
differential 
relations 
of 
the 
mode 
of 
production 
and 
the 
historicism 
of 
the 
ideological 
notion 
of 
history
EOS
hence 
his 
argument 
that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
history 
is 
no 
more 
historical 
than 
the 
knowledge 
of 
sugar 
is 
sweet
EOS
what 
then 
is 
the 
relation 
of 
science 
to 
ideology
of 
althusserian 
history 
to 
its 
ideological 
historicist 
formulation
EOS
the 
gap 
between 
them
according 
to 
althusser
is 
mediated 
by 
art
EOS
this 
statement 
is 
often 
regarded 
as 
a 
curious 
relic 
of 
the 
values 
of 
bourgeois 
culture
EOS
but 
it 
is 
also 
possible 
to 
see 
it 
as 
an 
attempt 
to 
formulate 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
sliding 
incompatibility 
of 
the 
two 
can 
only 
be 
perceived 
through 
an 
internal 
distantiation
in 
which 
the 
problem 
of 
that 
relation
is 
enacted 
by 
its 
relation 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
telling 
of 
a 
story 
which 
is 
how 
we 
get 
history
EOS
if 
history 
is 
a 
process
althusser 
remarks
there 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
a 
process 
except 
in 
relations 
sous 
des 
rapports 
EOS
history 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
relations
and 
thus 
of 
writing 
reports
EOS
althusser 
thus 
suggests 
that 
history 
can 
only 
be 
thought 
through 
as 
a 
permanent 
contradiction
it 
is 
a 
totality
but 
that 
totality 
is 
a 
decentred 
structure 
in 
dominance 
in 
which 
each 
history
's 
history 
is 
defined 
not 
through 
its 
identity 
with
or 
difference 
from
a 
general 
history 
but 
by 
being 
differentiated 
from 
every 
other 
history
on 
which 
it 
is 
necessarily 
also 
therefore 
dependent
in 
a 
kind 
of 
negative 
totalization
EOS
within 
the 
realm 
of 
ideology
on 
the 
other 
hand
history 
is 
experienced 
by 
subjects 
as 
a 
purposive 
continuum
with 
themselves 
as 
its 
subject
EOS
another 
way 
of 
putting 
this 
would 
be 
to 
say 
that 
althusser 
demonstrated 
that 
according 
to 
the 
protocols 
of 
conventional 
logic
history 
is 
impossible
EOS
if 
you 
try 
to 
think 
of 
it 
as 
a 
closed 
totality 
you 
get 
into 
the 
problems 
of 
historicism
if 
you 
try 
to 
think 
of 
it 
as 
entirely 
differentiated
then 
it 
becomes 
meaningless 
since 
there 
is 
no 
necessary 
connection
positive 
or 
negative
to 
anything 
else
nor 
would 
any 
one 
history 
produce 
any 
effect 
on 
another
EOS
any 
differential 
theory 
of 
identity 
must 
think 
both 
totality 
and 
difference 
simultaneously
EOS
it 
is 
this 
structure 
which 
both 
sartre
's 
singular 
universal
and 
althusser
's 
relative 
autonomy 
within 
a 
structure 
in 
dominance 
attempt 
to 
formulate
and 
in 
both 
cases 
the 
in-between 
of 
such 
simultaneity 
emerges 
as 
the 
process 
of 
writing 
itself
EOS
v 
if 
there 
is 
history
history
hermeneutics 
and 
historicity
EOS
with 
sartre 
and 
althusser 
we 
encounter 
the 
two 
poles 
of 
post-war 
french 
return-to-marxism
EOS
although 
both 
could 
be 
said 
to 
be 
reacting 
against 
the 
ossification 
of 
stalinism
the 
subjectivist 
and 
ultra-objectivist 
paths 
that 
they 
followed 
were 
antithetical
EOS
this 
schematic 
characterization
however
does 
not 
do 
justice 
either 
to 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
they 
attempted 
to 
keep 
both 
poles 
in 
play 
at 
once
nor 
to 
the 
way 
in 
which 
they 
came 
to 
concede 
the 
impossibility 
of 
the 
theoretical 
projects 
which 
they 
undertook
EOS
to 
dismiss 
them 
as 
failures 
on 
this 
account
however
would 
be 
merely 
reductive
EOS
their 
real 
force 
can 
be 
discerned 
from 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
problematics 
they 
set 
up 
have 
continued 
to 
exercise 
subsequent 
writers
EOS
since 
sartre 
and 
althusser 
no 
one 
has 
attempted 
a 
new 
theorization 
of 
a 
marxist 
history
EOS
we 
are 
not
therefore
now 
looking 
at 
another 
paradigm
another 
system
EOS
rather 
than 
attempting 
to 
repeat 
and 
surpass 
the 
exalted 
projects 
of 
sartre 
or 
althusser 
in 
a 
new 
guise
later 
writers 
such 
as 
foucault 
or 
derrida 
learnt 
a 
lesson 
from 
history
and 
stopped 
to 
ask 
why 
such 
comprehensive 
theories
like 
so 
many 
of 
those 
which 
preceded 
them
could 
not 
hold 
together
EOS
for 
the 
grand 
narrative 
of 
history 
was 
always 
too 
big 
for 
its 
boots
EOS
instead
therefore
of 
excluding 
history 
as 
has 
so 
often 
been 
claimed
such 
thinkers 
begin
in 
a 
rather 
more 
conventional 
way
from 
the 
anti-historicist 
perspectives 
of 
althusser
even
arguably
of 
sartre
EOS
the 
generic 
label 
poststructuralist
is 
here 
useful 
merely 
as 
a 
shorthand 
to 
designate 
those 
contemporary 
writers 
who 
share 
not 
a 
hostility 
to 
history 
as 
such 
but 
a 
distrust 
of 
simple 
historicisms
EOS
lyotard

example

best

his 
scepticism

the

the

attempted

the 
manner 
of

EOS
describing 
himself 
as 
very 
wary 
of

derrida 
has 
rather 
attempted 
to 
shift 
the

away 
from 
the 
conceptual 
analysis 
of 
history 
as 
an 
idea
which
perhaps 
more 
than 
anything 
else
has 
proved 
to 
be 
hegel

most 
enduring 
legacy

an 
analysis

interstices

the 
implications 
of 
the 
general 
system 
in 
which 
it 
operates
EOS
in 
the 
first 
instance
therefore
he 
focuses 
not 
on 
history 
as 
such 
but 
on 
the 
related 
problem 
of 
hermeneutics

historical 
understanding
history 
here 
becomes 
a 
problem 
of 
meaning

interpretation 
the

in 
fact 
constituted

this 
also 
involves 
an 
inquiry 
into 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
the 
critique 
of

affects 
historical 
representation

the 
dependence 
of

on

EOS
important 
though 
these 
issues 
are
derrida
's 
major 
contribution 
has 
been 
his 
insistence 
that 
history 
is 
a 
metaphysical 
concept 
according 
to 
which 
the 
meaning 
of

always 
amounts 
to 
the

he 
himself 
puts 
it
EOS
from 
the 
first 
texts

have 
attempted 
to 
systematize 
a 
deconstructive 
critique 
precisely 
against 
the

transcendental

determined 
in 
the 
last 
analysis 
as 
the 
history 
of

history 
in 
its 
logocentric
metaphysical
idealist
representation
EOS
the 
derridean 
critique 
of 
logocentrism 
necessarily 
includes 
the 
concept 
of 
history 
insofar 
as 
it 
depends 
on 
notions 
of 
presence 
and 
meaning 
determined 
as

EOS
for 
all 
its 
frequent 
invocation 
as 
the 
concrete
history 
must 
by 
definition 
entail 
a 
problematic 
represencing

therefore

applicable

consists 
of

a

the

in 
a 
broad 
sense 
he 
calls 
writing
or 
diffÃ©rance 
determines 
history
EOS
at 
the 
very 
opening 
of 
of 
grammatology 
for 
example
he 
sets 
out 
the 
thesis 
that 
writing 
constitutes 
the 
condition 
of 
emergence 
for 
all 
forms 
of 
historicity 
as 
such
EOS
historicity 
itself 
is 
tied 
to 
the 
possibility 
of 
writing
EOS
before 
being 
the 
object 
of 
a 
history 
of 
a 
historical 
science 
writing 
opens 
the 
field 
of 
history 
of 
historical 
becoming
EOS
language 
as 
the 
origin 
of 
history
on 
what 
basis 
does 
derrida 
make 
the 
startling 
and 
radical 
claim 
that 
writing 
as 
transcendence 
constitutes 
the 
condition 
of 
all 
historicity
EOS
in 
order 
to 
try 
to 
elucidate 
this 
controversial 
argument
we 
can 
return 
to 
the 
well-known 
remark 
in 
the 
essay 
diffÃ©rance
EOS
if 
the 
word 
history
did 
not 
carry 
with 
it 
the 
theme 
of 
a 
final 
repression 
of 
difference 
we 
could 
say 
that 
differences 
alone 
could 
be 
historical
through 
and 
through 
and 
from 
the 
start
EOS
here 
we 
revert 
to 
the 
dialectic 
of 
the 
same 
and 
the 
other
as 
derrida 
puts 
it
that 
the 
same
is 
never 
the 
identical
means 
first 
that 
being 
is 
history
EOS
it 
is 
only 
through 
difference
by 
which 
the 
same 
becomes 
other 
and 
produces 
a 
tissue 
of 
differences
that 
history 
could 
ever 
take 
place
for 
if 
full 
presence 
were 
possible
then 
there 
would 
be 
no 
difference
and 
therefore 
no 
time
space 
or 
history
EOS
diffÃ©rance 
means 
precisely 
that 
you 
can 
never 
get 
out 
of
and 
therefore 
have 
no 
need 
to 
get 
back 
to 
history
EOS
it 
also 
means 
that 
if 
difference 
in 
its 
sense 
of 
non-identity 
sets 
up 
the 
possibility 
of 
history
then 
difference 
in 
its 
sense 
of 
delay 
means 
also 
that 
it 
can 
never 
be 
finally 
concluded
for 
such 
deferral 
will 
always 
inhibit 
closure
EOS
it 
is 
in 
this 
sense 
that 
derrida 
argues 
that 
husserl
's 
origin 
of 
geometry 
sets 
up 
the 
possibility 
of 
history 
as 
the 
possibility 
of 
language
whereby 
difference 
would 
be 
transcendental
writing
in 
the 
general 
significance 
which 
derrida 
gives 
it 
of 
a 
differential 
marking
must 
be 
the 
condition 
of 
any 
historicity
EOS
history 
as 
diffÃ©rance 
then 
means 
that 
history 
will 
itself 
always 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
operations 
of 
diffÃ©rance 
and 
that 
diffÃ©rance 
names 
the 
form 
of 
its 
historicity
EOS
the 
same 
conditions 
hold 
for 
totalization
EOS
derrida 
argues 
that 
though 
history 
is 
given 
the 
form 
of 
a 
totality 
by 
hegel
his 
aufhebung 
shows 
that 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
that 
totality 
it 
must 
constantly 
transcend 
itself 
in 
a 
movement 
of 
excess
EOS
history
EOS
is 
the 
history 
of 
the 
departures 
from 
totality
history 
as 
the 
very 
movement 
of 
transcendence
of 
the 
excess 
over 
the 
totality 
without 
which 
no 
totality 
would 
appear 
as 
such
EOS
history 
is 
not 
the 
totality 
transcended 
by 
eschatology
metaphysics
or 
speech
EOS
it 
is 
transcendence 
itself
EOS
history
in 
fact
works 
by 
exactly 
the 
same 
structure 
of 
supplementarity 
as 
derrida 
charts 
in 
of 
grammatology 
EOS
here 
rousseau 
himself 
demonstrates 
in 
his 
oscillating 
interpretations 
a 
history 
that 
can
not 
be 
linear
nor 
operate 
according 
to 
a 
single 
temporality
disturbing 
instead
the 
time 
of 
the 
line 
or 
the 
line 
of 
time
EOS
we 
may 
perceive 
here 
the 
strange 
workings 
of 
the 
historical 
process 
according 
to 
rousseau
EOS
it 
never 
varies
beginning 
with 
an 
origin 
or 
a 
centre 
that 
divides 
itself 
and 
leaves 
itself
an 
historical 
circle 
is 
described
which 
is 
degenerative 
in 
direction 
but 
progressive 
and 
compensatory 
in 
effect
EOS
on 
the 
circumference 
of 
that 
circle 
are 
new 
origins 
for 
new 
circles 
that 
accelerate 
the 
degeneration 
by 
annulling 
the 
compensatory 
effects 
of 
the 
preceding 
circle
and 
thereby 
also 
making 
its 
truth 
and 
beneficence 
appear
EOS
such 
a 
history 
can
not 
be 
represented 
by 
the 
movement 
of 
a 
linear 
progression 
of 
unfolding 
time
EOS
its 
transcendence
marks 
the 
way 
in 
which 
it 
can 
similarly 
never 
be 
limited 
to 
a 
finite 
totality
nor
conversely
to 
an 
infinity
EOS
it 
exceeds 
itself
EOS
this 
process 
of 
supplementation
this 
overabundance 
of 
the 
signifier
that 
always 
goes 
beyond 
itself
is 
the 
result 
of 
a 
lack
or 
absence 
at 
the 
centre 
or 
origin
which 
must 
always 
be 
supplemented
EOS
thus 
the 
argument 
that 
history
is 
what 
poststructuralism
lacks
itself 
repeats 
totalization
's 
own 
structure 
of 
supplementarity 
according 
to 
which 
history 
functions 
both 
as 
an 
excess 
and 
a 
lack 
in 
the 
origin
EOS
insofar 
as 
it 
sets 
up 
such 
a 
process 
of 
necessary 
and 
constant 
supplementation
we 
could 
say 
that 
the 
impossibility 
of 
totalization 
produces 
a 
writing-effect 
whose 
process 
of 
perpetual 
deferral 
unremittingly 
provokes 
more 
writing
EOS
it 
is 
thus 
no 
longer 
a 
question 
of 
being 
able 
to 
produce 
a 
new 
concept 
of 
history
which
as 
derrida 
puts 
it
is 
difficult
if 
not 
impossible
to 
lift 
from 
its 
teleological 
or 
eschatological 
horizon 
EOS
history 
can
not 
be 
done 
away 
with 
any 
more 
than 
metaphysics
but 
its 
conditions 
of 
impossibility 
are 
also 
necessarily 
its 
conditions 
of 
possibility
EOS
this 
means
as 
rodolphe 
gaschÃ© 
observes
that 
the 
mimicry 
of 
totality 
and 
of 
the 
pretension 
to 
systematicity 
is 
an 
inseparable 
element 
of 
deconstruction
one 
of 
the 
very 
conditions 
of  
finding 
its 
foothold 
within 
the 
logic 
being 
deconstructed
EOS
derrida 
himself
therefore
does 
not 
in 
any 
sense 
abjure 
history 
or 
totality
but 
rather 
attempts 
to 
reinscribe 
it 
by 
writing 
histories 
that 
set 
up 
supplementary 
figures 
whose 
logic 
simultaneously 
invokes 
and 
works 
against 
historical 
totalities
EOS
from 
this 
perspective
even 
sartre
's 
critique 
looks 
rather 
different 
from 
the 
way 
it 
appeared 
in 
the 
early 
sixties 
when 
read 
in 
the 
context 
of 
lukÃ¡cs
' 
history 
and 
class 
consciousness 
EOS
today 
it 
seems 
to 
evince 
a 
growing 
recognition 
that 
totalization 
can
not 
be 
achieved 
without 
a 
movement 
involving 
the 
transcendence 
of 
itself
EOS
in 
sartre
's 
terms
a 
totalization 
needs 
a 
totalizer
EOS
it 
must 
always 
involve 
an 
excess 
beyond 
the 
totality 
without 
which 
the 
totality 
could 
never 
be 
totalized
which 
must 
mean 
that 
it 
can 
never 
in 
fact 
be 
closed
EOS
lyotard 
points 
to 
exactly 
the 
same 
structure 
in 
marx
who 
could 
likewise 
never 
complete 
capital 
EOS
this 
endlessness 
of 
perpetual 
deferral
he 
argues
is 
later 
formalized 
in 
a 
tragic 
political 
party
the 
negative 
dialectic 
of 
the 
aufklÃ¤rung 
it 
is 
the 
frankfurt 
school
demythologized
lutheran
nihilistic 
marxism
EOS
but 
instead 
of 
the 
perpetual 
threat 
of 
totalization
a 
spectre 
which 
the 
frankfurt 
school 
anticipates 
endlessly
derrida 
suggests 
rather 
that 
the 
problem 
in 
any 
structure 
is 
rather 
how 
it 
achieves 
closure
EOS
even 
if 
this 
appears 
to 
have 
occurred
a 
deconstructive 
account 
will 
show 
how 
such 
a 
text 
had 
to 
dissimulate 
in 
order 
to 
cover 
over 
its 
own 
openings
or
to 
put 
it 
the 
other 
way 
round
it 
will 
show 
how 
history 
must 
always 
be 
organized 
by 
an 
attempted 
occlusion 
of 
its 
own 
conditions 
of 
historicity
EOS
this 
means 
that 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
reject 
totalization 
as 
such 
because 
such 
a 
rejection 
assumes 
its 
very 
possibility
whereas 
all 
attempts 
at 
totalization 
such 
as 
sartre
's 
demonstrate 
rather 
its 
impossibility
EOS
peter 
dews 
has 
recently 
claimed 
that 
post-structuralism 
can 
be 
understood 
as 
the 
point 
at 
which 
the 
logic 
of 
disintegration
penetrates 
into 
the 
thought 
which 
attempts 
to 
comprehend 
it
resulting 
in 
a 
dispersal 
into 
a 
plurality 
of 
inconsistent 
logics
EOS
so 
poststructuralism 
is 
itself 
the 
shattered 
mirror 
of 
the 
logic 
of 
disintegration
EOS
but 
poststructuralism 
precisely 
does 
not 
try 
to 
comprehend 
disintegration
for 
grasping 
heterogeneity 
together 
is 
exactly 
what 
all 
totalizing 
theories 
have 
unsuccessfully 
attempted 
to 
do
EOS
having 
elaborated 
the 
paradoxical 
conditions 
of 
historicity
of 
any 
history 
or 
totalization
derrida 
himself 
has 
been 
particularly 
concerned 
to 
analyse 
those 
such 
as 
husserl
heidegger 
or 
levinas
who 
have 
been 
involved 
in 
investigations 
of 
time 
and 
temporality
EOS
although 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
pursue 
the 
question 
of 
history 
in 
terms 
of 
such 
analyses 
of 
the 
forms 
of 
historicity
such 
an 
enquiry 
would 
take 
us 
on 
a 
very 
different 
path 
from 
that 
prompted 
by 
our 
original 
question
namely 
if 
poststructuralism 
can 
apparently 
be 
faulted 
by 
reference 
to 
a 
history 
which 
it 
neglects
where 
in 
marxism 
can 
this 
history 
be 
found
EOS
since 
sartre 
and 
althusser 
there 
have 
been 
a 
number 
of 
possibilities
for 
some
the 
absolute 
historicism 
of 
the  
frankfurt 
school 
has 
become 
increasingly 
attractive
although 
in 
its 
current 
manifestation 
in 
the 
work 
of 
habermas 
we 
might 
say 
that 
history 
has 
been 
eclipsed 
far 
more 
effectively 
than 
by 
any 
comparable 
french 
philosopher
EOS
if 
althusser 
gave 
us 
history 
without 
a 
subject
habermas 
gives 
us 
subjects 
without 
history
EOS
otherwise 
there 
have 
been 
two 
possibilities 
which 
effectively 
continue 
the 
lines 
of 
descent 
from 
hegelian 
historicism 
and 
the 
history 
of 
science
EOS
the 
most 
notable 
representative 
of 
the 
latter 
has 
been 
michel 
foucault
who 
has 
remorselessly 
continued 
the 
critique 
of 
totalizing 
forms 
of 
history 
and 
the 
disavowal 
of 
a 
general 
philosophy 
of 
history 
in 
favour 
of 
strategic 
genealogical
analyses
EOS
the 
alternative 
to 
this 
has 
amounted 
to 
a 
reaffirmation 
of 
historicism 
almost 
as 
if 
nothing 
had 
happened
EOS
this 
has 
been 
the 
course 
of 
perry 
anderson
who 
after 
his 
althusserian 
moment 
has 
returned 
to 
espouse 
the 
virtues 
of 
empirical 
historical 
studies
under 
the 
general 
aegis 
of 
a 
historicism 
anchored 
in 
the 
recasting 
of 
orthodox 
historical 
materialism 
by 
g.a
EOS
cohen
EOS
more 
influential 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
literary

cultural 
theory

been 
another 
overt 
defence 
of 
historicism 
that 
of 
fredric 
jameson

it 
is 
to 
foucault

to 
jameson 
that

now 
turn

foucault

phantasms
EOS
it 
is 
in 
the 
work 
of 
michel 
foucault 
that 
we 
find 
the 
most 
unrelenting 
offensive 
against 
historicist 
theories 
of 
history
EOS
but 
foucault 
at 
least 
can 
hardly 
be 
accused 
of 
neglecting 
history 
as 
such
EOS
the 
demise 
of 
althusserianism 
has 
meant 
that 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
subsequent 
writers
such 
as 
foucault 
or 
even 
derrida
continued 
to 
work 
within 
the 
problematic 
that 
his 
work 
had 
established
has 
tended 
to 
be 
overlooked
EOS
it 
was 
althusser 
who
after 
sartre
problematized 
the 
very 
concept 
of 
history 
and 
laid 
the 
basis 
for 
much 
subsequent 
theoretical 
investigation
EOS
in 
the 
post-althusserian 
context 
of 
today 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
somewhat 
startling 
to 
find 
the 
althusser 
of 
reading 
capital 
citing 
his 
debt 
to 
foucault 
along 
with 
bachelard
cavaillÃ¨s

canguilhem

one 
of 
our 
masters

perhaps 
even 
more 
unexpected
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
popular 
british 
marxist 
position 
on 
althusser 
is 
that 
he 
simply 
turned 
history 
into 
theory

the 
choice 
of 
foucault
's 
madness

civilization 
that 
great 
work'
and 
the 
birth 
of 
the 
clinic 
as 
examples 
of 
the 
kind 
of 
history
focused 
on 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
production 
of 
a 
concept
that 
he 
was 
advocating
EOS
in 
certain 
respects 
foucault 
always 
remained 
close 
to 
the 
general 
positions 
from 
which 
althusser 
worked
particularly 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
bachelard 
and 
his 
scepticism 
towards 
progressivist 
and 
homogeneous 
histories
EOS
all 
were 
concerned 
to 
establish 
the 
possibility 
of 
discontinuity 
in 
a 
history

althusser 
described 
it
no 
longer
steeped 
in 
the 
ideology

the 
philosophy

the 
enlightenment

in 
a 
teleological

therefore 
idealist 
rationalism

his

an 
epistemological 
study

the

the

for 
canguilhem 
the 
history

have 
its 
own 
specific 
temporality

less 
a 
process 
of 
epistemological 
self-correction

the

the 
contradictory

been 
given

make 
up 
its

the

of 
the 
battle 
between 
different 
discursive 
regimes
EOS
foucault
's 
contribution 
was 
to 
adapt 
this 
type 
of 
analysis 
from 
the 
life-sciences 
to 
the 
human 
and 
social 
sciences
EOS
typically
his 
history 
takes 
the 
form 
of 
establishing 
a 
concept 
of 
something 
that 
chronological 
history 
would 
assume 
had 
no 
history
for 
example
madness
or 
sexuality
EOS
in 
relation 
to 
the 
almost 
antithetical 
marxist 
positions 
of 
sartre 
and 
althusser
foucault 
does 
not
however
simply 
follow 
the 
latter 
rather 
than 
the 
former
he 
articulates 
through 
a 
historical 
perspective 
the 
problems 
that 
their 
work 
encountered 
and 
attempts 
to 
produce 
a 
new 
method 
of 
historical 
enquiry 
though 
not 
a 
general 
theory 
of 
history 
as 
such 
that 
is 
both 
theoretically 
coherent 
and 
politically 
effective 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
particular 
problems 
under 
examination
EOS
that 
history 
and 
marxism 
as 
such 
are 
casualties 
of 
this 
process 
is 
one 
obvious 
reason 
why 
attacks 
upon 
foucault 
have 
been 
particularly 
virulent
EOS
foucault 
objects 
to 
historicism 
and 
western 
humanism 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
assume 
a 
continuous 
development
progress
and 
global 
totalization
EOS
to 
this 
he 
adds 
his 
own 
more 
individual 
list 
of 
suspect 
conceptual 
categories
the 
subject
class
ideology
repression
the 
science/non-science 
distinction
as 
well 
as 
any 
general 
theory 
of 
society
causality
or 
of 
history 
itself
EOS
it 
is 
interesting 
that 
despite 
this 
some 
writers 
are 
still 
prepared 
nevertheless 
to 
claim 
foucault 
as 
a 
marxist 
perhaps 
less 
an 
indication 
of 
his 
marxism 
than 
of 
his 
discursive 
power 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
alternatives 
within 
marxism 
today
EOS
foucault 
emphasizes 
that 
his 
work 
does 
not 
lay 
claim 
to 
universal 
or 
general 
categories
nor 
is 
it 
even 
homogeneous
a 
presupposition 
that
as 
he 
has 
shown
has 
less 
to 
do 
with 
the 
work 
as 
such 
than 
the 
critical 
construction 
of 
its 
author
EOS
nevertheless 
we 
can 
say 
at 
least 
that 
his 
preoccupation 
with 
history 
has 
been 
consistent 
throughout
the 
articulation 
of 
repressed 
history 
in 
madness 
and 
civilization 
1961
the 
historicity 
of 
history 
in 
the 
order 
of 
things 
1966
the 
epistemic 
mutation 
of 
history 
and 
the 
theoretical 
difficulties 
of 
historiography 
in 
the 
archaeology 
of 
knowledge 
1969
and 
the 
attempt 
to 
write 
a 
different 
kind 
of

genealogy
that 
demonstrates 
the 
emergence 
of 
new 
forms 
of  
power 
in 
discipline 
and 
punish 
1975
and 
the 
history 
of 
sexuality 
1976â€“84
EOS
like 
many 
of 
those 
discussed 
in 
this 
book
foucault 
endorses 
the 
ethico-political 
project 
of 
establishing 
forms 
of 
knowledge 
that 
do 
not 
simply 
turn 
the 
other 
into 
the 
same
as 
he 
put 
it 
in 
1968
he 
wishes 
to 
find 
another 
politics 
than 
that 
which 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century
stubbornly 
persists 
in 
seeing 
in 
the 
immense 
domain 
of 
practice 
only 
the 
epiphany 
of 
a 
triumphant 
reason
or 
in 
deciphering 
in 
it 
only 
the 
historico-transcendental 
destination 
of 
the 
west
EOS
this 
focus 
on 
the 
link 
between 
the 
structures 
of 
knowledge 
and 
of 
power 
is 
increasingly 
related 
to 
an 
accompanying 
analysis 
of 
the 
discursive 
and 
technological 
mechanisms 
of 
repression 
and 
domination
EOS
these 
ethico-political 
concerns 
formed 
the 
basis 
of 
his 
early 
works 
on 
madness
as 
he 
announced 
in 
his 
first 
book
mental 
illness 
and 
psychology 
1954
EOS
one 
day 
an 
attempt 
must 
be 
made 
to 
study 
madness 
as 
an 
overall 
structure 
madness 
freed 
and 
disalienated
restored 
in 
some 
sense 
to 
its 
original 
language
EOS
madness 
and 
civilization 
was 
such 
a 
study
but 
the 
assumption 
that 
it 
was 
possible 
simply 
to 
lift 
the 
repression 
and 
to 
let 
otherness 
speak 
for 
itself 
was 
questioned 
by 
derrida 
in 
his 
well-known 
critique
cogito 
and 
the 
history 
of 
madness
EOS
it 
is 
in 
this 
context 
that 
we 
can 
see 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
so-called 
derrida-foucault 
debate 
which 
is 
often 
misrepresented
not 
least 
by 
foucault 
himself
as 
a 
confrontation 
between 
textuality
and 
history
EOS
but 
foucault
's 
own 
subsequent 
work 
shows 
that 
it 
could 
not 
really 
be 
a 
question 
of 
choice 
on 
these 
terms
for 
the 
simple 
reason 
that
as 
he 
himself 
is 
at 
pains 
to 
point 
out 
in 
the 
order 
of 
things 
history 
is 
itself 
a 
discursive 
practice
while 
the 
latter 
can
not 
be 
simply 
equated 
with 
the 
textual
it 
can
not 
be 
crudely 
opposed 
to 
it 
either
EOS
the 
dispute 
between 
derrida 
and 
foucault 
was 
less 
a 
question 
of 
text 
versus 
history 
than 
an 
argument 
about 
history 
itself
EOS
derrida 
focuses 
on 
foucault
's 
claim 
that 
in 
madness 
and 
civilization 
he 
is 
writing 
a 
history 
of 
the 
other
EOS
his 
critique 
centres 
on 
two 
related 
problems
in 
the 
first 
place 
if
as 
foucault 
argues
the 
expulsion 
of 
madness 
by 
reason 
constitutes 
the 
possibility 
of 
history 
as 
such
so 
that 
this 
gesture 
of 
exclusion 
produces 
the 
fundamental 
structure 
of 
historicity
then 
the 
classical
moment 
of 
this 
proscription 
that 
he 
describes 
must 
be 
an 
example 
rather 
than 
an 
originary 
moment
EOS
in 
the 
second 
place
if 
reason 
is 
defined 
by 
its 
elimination 
of 
madness
and 
if 
history 
is 
a 
rational 
concept
the 
question 
then 
follows
how 
can 
you 
write 
a 
history 
of 
madness
EOS
derrida 
comments
it 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
history
or 
archia 
that 
should 
have 
been 
questioned 
first
perhaps
'
EOS
implicitly 
he 
is 
criticizing 
foucault
's 
understanding 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
same 
to 
the 
other 
which 
posits 
madness 
as 
outside 
the 
sphere 
of 
reason
EOS
to 
regard 
the 
latter 
as 
systematically 
oppressing 
madness 
and  
forcing 
it 
to 
the 
margins 
to 
literature
or 
the 
hospital 
is 
simply 
to 
repeat
in 
reverse
the 
very 
structure 
that 
is 
being 
criticized
EOS
derrida 
contends 
that 
if 
madness 
is 
constituted 
as 
madness
as 
other
by 
reason
then 
this 
means 
that 
reason 
is 
itself 
defined 
through 
it 
and 
therefore 
already 
contains 
and 
depends 
upon 
it
EOS
madness 
can
not 
be 
considered 
to 
exist 
outside 
the 
historical 
conditions 
of 
its 
production 
and 
could 
never 
therefore 
be 
restored
to 
its 
original 
language
as 
foucault 
hopes
EOS
the 
problem 
for 
foucault 
is 
that 
this 
argument 
involves 
more 
than 
just 
madness 
as 
such
for 
it 
really 
amounts 
to 
a 
questioning 
of 
the 
very 
possibility 
of 
critique
EOS
in 
his 
early 
work 
we 
can 
see 
that 
foucault
's 
position 
involves 
a 
remarkable 
development 
of 
althusser
's 
hints 
that 
art 
can 
function 
as 
a 
privileged 
category 
that 
provides 
an 
internal 
distance
from 
ideology 
by 
relating 
histories
writing 
reports
EOS
something 
of 
the 
same 
special 
place 
of 
retreat
for 
art
especially 
literature 
and 
painting
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
foucault
EOS
david 
carroll 
has 
recently 
emphasized 
the 
significance 
of
a 
transgressive 
aesthetics 
or 
poetics 
of 
self-reflexivity' 
in 
his 
work
EOS
such 
self-reflexivity
far 
from 
involving 
a 
turning 
inwards 
as 
is 
so 
often 
generally 
supposed
comprises 
rather 
an 
edge 
or 
void 
from 
which 
a 
critical 
perspective 
can 
be 
opened 
up
a 
thinking 
of 
the 
outside
EOS
so 
madness
or 
certain 
radical 
forms 
of 
writing
such 
as 
that 
of 
sade
bataille
blanchot 
or 
roussel
by 
transgressing 
the 
limits 
of 
order 
and 
turning 
back 
to 
reflect 
upon 
it
enable 
a 
space 
from 
which 
a 
critique 
can 
be 
made
EOS
this 
self-reflexivity 
operates 
at 
the 
limit 
of 
reason 
or 
history
eluding 
even 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
epistemes 
EOS
in 
this 
schema
foucault 
is 
therefore 
proposing 
a 
fundamental
enabling 
separation 
between 
writing 
and 
history
EOS
but 
after 
derrida
's 
essay
foucault 
abandoned 
his 
claims 
that 
certain 
forms 
of 
literature 
could 
effect 
such 
a 
critical
reflective 
detachment
EOS
this 
led 
to 
two 
problems
is 
there 
then 
any 
space 
from 
which 
a 
critique 
can 
be 
established
and 
how 
does 
foucault 
reformulate 
the 
relation 
of 
writing 
to 
history
EOS
in 
his 
subsequent 
work
the 
connection 
between 
the 
two 
would 
remain 
profoundly 
equivocal
EOS
the 
seriousness 
of 
derrida
's 
intervention 
can 
be 
discerned 
from 
foucault
's 
subsequent 
repudiation 
of 
the 
central 
thesis 
of 
madness 
and 
civilization 
and 
the 
change 
of 
direction 
that 
his 
work 
took 
thereafter
EOS
this 
is 
apparent 
from 
his 
rethinking 
of 
the 
age-old 
distinction 
between 
the 
same 
and 
the 
other
EOS
while 
he 
retained 
his 
criticisms 
of 
rationality
foucault 
substituted 
the 
idea 
of 
an 
otherness 
at 
work 
within 
reason 
for 
that 
of 
a 
repressed 
alterity 
existing 
outside 
or 
beyond 
it
EOS
if 
madness 
or 
the 
other 
is 
always 
inside
then 
this 
means 
that 
it 
is 
always 
already 
a 
part 
of 
reason 
or 
the 
same
but 
it 
will 
also 
be 
exactly 
the 
element 
that 
reason 
is 
unable 
to 
comprehend
and 
will 
therefore 
work 
disruptively
EOS
this 
reformulation 
shows 
why 
it 
was 
necessary 
for 
foucault 
to 
free 
himself 
from 
what 
he 
later 
termed 
the 
repressive 
hypothesis
of 
liberation
EOS
it 
also 
provides 
the 
context 
in 
which 
to 
consider 
both 
the 
claim 
that 
for 
the 
later 
foucault 
knowledge 
is 
absolutely 
determined
leaving 
him 
in 
the 
impossible 
situation 
of 
requiring 
something  
outside 
this 
for 
any 
prospect 
of 
critique
as 
well 
as 
the 
question 
of 
exactly 
how 
power 
and 
resistance 
are 
interdependent 
and 
to 
what 
extent 
they 
are 
separable
EOS
any 
answer 
to 
these 
problems 
must 
take 
foucault
's 
own 
resituating 
of 
the 
dialectic 
of 
the 
same 
and 
the 
other 
into 
account
EOS
even 
so
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
obvious 
how 
he 
relocates 
writing 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
history 
to 
which 
it 
had 
until 
then 
been 
opposed
EOS
if 
it 
had 
previously 
operated 
critically 
outside 
history
's 
limits
offering 
the 
only 
available 
possibility 
of 
critical 
distance
how 
might 
writing 
work 
transgressively 
within 
it
EOS
ii 
differentiated 
histories
EOS
in 
the 
order 
of 
things 
published 
three 
years 
after 
derrida
's 
critique
foucault 
re-examines 
the 
links 
between 
enlightenment 
rationality 
and 
history 
and 
poses 
the 
questions 
about 
the 
latter 
which 
derrida 
had 
suggested 
that 
foucault
's 
work 
invites
EOS
in 
the 
preface 
he 
resituated 
his 
earlier 
formulations 
as 
follows
EOS
the 
history 
of 
madness 
would 
be 
the 
history 
of 
the 
other 
of 
that 
which
for 
a 
given 
culture
is 
at 
once 
interior 
and 
foreign
therefore 
to 
be 
excluded 
so 
as 
to 
exorcise 
the 
interior 
danger
but 
by 
being 
shut 
away 
in 
order 
to 
reduce 
its 
otherness
whereas 
the 
history 
of 
the 
order 
imposed 
on 
things 
would 
be 
the 
history 
of 
the 
same 
of 
that 
which
for 
a 
given 
culture
is 
both 
dispersed 
and 
related
therefore 
to 
be 
distinguished 
by 
kinds 
and 
to 
be 
collected 
together 
into 
identities
EOS

EOS
foucault 
thus 
modifies 
his 
argument 
that 
reason 
simply 
excluded 
madness 
and 
initiated 
the 
possibility 
of 
history 
by 
suggesting 
instead 
that 
the 
histories 
of 
the 
other 
and 
of 
the 
same 
are 
necessarily 
implicated 
within 
each 
other
EOS
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
refuses 
derrida
's 
equation 
of 
historicity 
with 
difference 
as 
such
instead 
reformulating 
his 
former 
thesis 
so 
that 
now 
history 
itself 
takes 
part 
in 
the 
epistemic 
shifts 
that 
he 
traces
EOS
initially 
foucault 
argues 
that 
the 
stasis 
of 
what 
he 
calls 
the 
classical 
order
gave 
way 
to 
history
which 
took 
over 
both 
as 
the 
form 
of 
knowledge 
and 
as 
the 
fundamental 
mode 
of 
being 
for 
empirical 
phenomena
EOS
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
order 
of 
things 
however
he 
revises 
this 
somewhat 
conventional 
thesis 
to 
suggest 
that 
what 
was 
involved 
was 
not 
so 
much 
a 
move 
from 
a 
static 
to 
a 
historical 
view 
of 
things 
as 
the 
break-up 
of 
a 
common
unified 
historical 
time-scheme 
in 
which 
every 
phenomenon 
had 
had 
its 
place 
in 
the 
same 
space 
and 
chronology
EOS
in 
place 
of 
a 
unity 
of 
time 
came 
the 
notion 
of 
discrete 
temporalities
with 
a 
recognition 
of 
a 
historicity 
proper 
to 
each 
discipline 
or 
area 
of 
knowledge
EOS
instead 
of 
a 
great 
historical 
narrative 
common 
to 
ill
everything 
now 
had 
its 
own 
chronology 
and 
its 
own 
history
EOS
the 
effect 
of 
this 
was 
to 
dehistoricize 
man 
himself
EOS
whereas 
formerly 
he 
had 
been 
the 
subject 
of 
history
taking 
pride 
of 
place 
in 
god
's 
historical 
scheme 
from 
creation 
onwards
now 
the 
human 
being 
no 
longer 
has 
any 
history
or 
rather
since 
he 
speaks
works
and 
lives
he 
finds 
himself 
interwoven 
in 
his 
own 
being 
with 
histories 
that 
are 
neither 
subordinate 
to 
him 
nor 
homogeneous 
with

which
through 
their 
organization 
around 
the 
figure 
of 
man
once 
more 
brought 
about 
a 
unity 
to 
history
EOS
we 
shall 
examine 
the 
relation 
of 
this 
new 
humanism 
to 
the 
history 
of 
western 
colonialism 
in 
a 
later 
chapter
it 
is 
not 
a 
question 
that 
foucault 
himself 
elaborates 
in 
the 
course 
of 
what 
is 
claimed 
to 
be 
an
ethnology 
of 
western 
culture'
EOS
rather 
he 
points 
to 
the 
theoretical 
paradox 
involved
namely 
that 
the 
human 
sciences
' 
very 
emphasis 
on 
historicity 
as 
a 
mode 
of 
being 
was 
equally 
applicable 
to 
themselves 
as 
forms 
of 
knowledge
and 
inevitably 
destroyed 
any 
attempt 
to 
formulate 
universal 
laws 
comparable 
to 
those 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences
EOS
here 
we 
can 
see 
a 
rather 
different 
perspective 
on 
the 
human 
alienation 
which 
lukÃ¡cs 
describes
in 
foucault
's 
account
marxism
's 
attempt 
to 
reproduce 
the 
totality 
in 
itself 
falls 
within 
the 
terms 
of 
his 
argument 
by 
which 
totalizing 
theories 
of 
history 
are 
based 
on 
an 
anxiety 
derived 
from 
the 
break-up 
of 
its 
unity
EOS
marxism
's 
claim 
to 
the 
status 
of 
a 
science 
proper 
thus 
functions 
as 
a 
device 
to 
avoid 
the 
historicity 
through 
which 
it 
accounts 
for 
other 
phenomena 
EOS
the 
order 
of 
things 
by 
contrast 
points 
to 
the 
emergence 
of 
historicity 
as 
a 
mode 
of 
understanding
and 
argues 
that 
history
both 
as 
a 
form 
of 
knowledge 
and 
as 
the 
primary 
state 
of 
being 
of 
empirical 
phenomena 
broadly 
speaking
the 
assumption 
of 
all 
marxisms 
is 
itself 
a 
historical 
phenomenon 
EOS
this 
means 
that 
history 
can
not 
provide 
an 
unquestionable 
ground 
for 
knowledge
and 
that 
historicity 
can
not 
claim 
an 
a 
priori 
privilege 
as 
the 
fundamental 
mode 
of 
being 
either
EOS
as 
the 
two 
counter-sciences
ethnology 
and 
psychoanalysis 
have 
suggested
history 
is 
simply 
one 
possible 
discursive 
form 
of 
understanding 
even 
if 
its 
problematic 
of 
temporality 
spills 
over 
into 
many 
others
EOS
in 
making 
this 
argument
however
foucault 
is 
not 
concerned 
to 
dispense 
with 
history 
rather 
to 
make 
history 
itself 
an 
object 
of 
historical 
investigation 
and 
to 
question 
its 
presuppositions
EOS
in 
particular
he 
challenges 
hegel
's 
equation 
in 
the 
phenomenology 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
history 
with 
the 
developing 
consciousness 
of 
man 
himself
EOS
although 
this 
has 
been 
particularly 
influential 
for 
many 
forms 
of 
western 
marxism
it 
also 
represents 
a 
deviation 
from 
marx
's 
original 
claim 
that 
history 
is 
the 
effect 
of 
material  
conditions 
rather 
than 
of 
human 
consciousness
EOS
in 
this 
way 
foucault 
could 
be 
said 
to 
be 
returning 
to 
marx 
in 
removing 
the 
subject 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
history
were 
it 
not 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
dispenses 
with 
the 
consolations 
of 
marx
's 
historicism 
also
EOS
in 
this 
situation 
he 
asks
how 
do 
we 
come 
to 
terms 
with 
the 
event
with 
continuities 
and 
discontinuities
in 
short 
with 
history 
as 
difference 
and 
not 
just 
the 
story 
of 
sameness
EOS
foucault 
adopts 
a 
strategy
obviously 
indebted 
to 
bachelard
designed 
to 
restore 
the 
otherness 
that 
history 
by 
definition 
must 
disallow
he 
produces 
an 
account 
of 
epistemic 
shifts
with 
prior 
epistemes 
presented 
as 
altogether 
estranged 
from 
the 
present
EOS
in 
order 
to 
come 
to 
terms 
with 
the 
past
the 
initial 
gesture 
must 
be 
to 
confront 
its 
strangeness
rather 
than 
to 
seek 
for 
similarities 
and 
continuities 
so 
that 
it 
can 
be 
equated 
with 
the 
present 
and 
thus
in 
effect
dehistoricized
EOS
following 
althusser
's 
suggestion 
that 
a 
historical 
problematic 
might 
be 
altogether 
invisible 
even 
to 
experiencing 
subjects
in 
the 
order 
of 
things 
foucault 
analyses 
what 
he 
provocatively 
calls 
the 
historical 
a 
priori 
according 
to 
which 
the 
knowledges 
of 
grammar
natural 
history 
and 
wealth
and 
their 
epistemic 
replacements
philology
biology
and 
political 
economy
were 
structured
EOS
but 
as 
with 
althusser
's 
modes 
of 
production
so 
foucault
's 
attempt 
to 
elaborate 
a 
positive 
unconscious 
of 
knowledge 
was 
criticized 
by 
sartre
and 
subsequently 
by 
many 
others
for 
being 
unable 
to 
give 
any 
account 
of 
change 
and 
for 
implying 
a 
total 
discontinuity 
between 
periods
EOS
the 
objection 
that 
foucault 
neglects 
history 
because 
he 
does 
not 
attempt 
to 
give 
reasons 
why 
the 
epistemic 
shifts 
he 
describes 
occurred 
is 
perhaps 
inevitable 
but 
also 
begs 
the 
question
for 
conventional 
historiography 
has 
in 
general 
done 
nothing 
but 
account 
for 
such 
shifts 
which 
has 
meant 
that 
it 
has 
consistently 
failed 
to 
recognize 
alterity 
and 
incommensurability 
in 
its 
insistent 
search 
for 
continuities 
with 
the 
past
EOS
without 
history 
as 
a 
form 
of 
mediation 
the 
differences 
return 
as 
the 
problem
and 
it 
was 
this 
which
according 
to 
foucault
the 
order 
of 
things 
was 
really 
trying 
to 
address
EOS
here 
we 
might 
recall 
derrida
's 
criticism 
of 
levinas
's 
history 
as 
a 
blinding 
to 
the 
other
and 
as 
the 
laborious 
procession 
of 
the 
same
EOS
in 
the 
face 
of 
a 
history 
which 
obscures 
such 
discontinuities
the 
first 
stage 
for 
foucault
therefore
is 
to 
defamiliarize 
it 
by 
reconstituting 
it 
without 
the 
mythology 
of 
a 
continuous 
history 
which 
has 
turned 
difference 
into 
identity
EOS
it 
is 
often 
assumed 
that 
foucault 
is 
simply 
the 
philosopher 
of 
discontinuity
merely 
substituting 
it 
where 
previously 
there 
had 
been 
continuity
but 
the 
discontinuous 
is 
emphasized 
only 
because 
so 
much 
stress 
is 
normally 
placed 
on 
the 
continuous
EOS
it 
is 
not 
just 
a 
question 
of 
exchanging 
one 
for 
the 
other
EOS
this 
has 
a 
methodological 
implication 
as 
well
all 
too 
often 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
foucault
's 
stress 
on 
disruption 
can 
be 
taken 
as 
equivalent 
to 
randomness
as 
we 
have 
seen 
with 
perry 
anderson
EOS
however
it 
is 
more 
helpful 
to 
consider 
it 
in 
the 
context 
of 
canguilhem
who 
emphasized 
that 
the 
life 
sciences
like 
the 
natural 
sciences
require 
their 
own 
specific 
mode 
of 
history
they 
show 
that 
historical 
method 
itself 
must 
be  
heterogeneous
in 
the 
sense 
that 
there 
is 
no 
single 
method 
applicable 
to 
the 
whole 
range 
of 
different 
histories
EOS
even 
the 
history 
of 
discontinuities 
is 
itself 
impermanent 
and 
discontinuous
EOS
if 
certain 
forms 
of 
history 
stress 
continuity
try 
to 
account 
for 
change
the 
history 
of 
science 
by 
contrast 
must 
be 
disjointed
for 
it 
is 
made 
up 
of 
a 
series 
of 
corrections 
in 
which 
the 
errors 
of 
the 
past 
have 
to 
be 
simply 
discarded
EOS
foucault
as 
we 
have 
seen
is 
also 
criticized 
on 
the 
grounds 
that 
he 
can
not 
give 
a 
cause 
for 
the 
shifts 
he 
describes
but 
this 
criticism 
itself 
begs 
the 
question 
insofar 
as 
it 
assumes 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
history
which 
itself 
presupposes 
that 
there 
was 
a 
cause 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
a 
single 
uniform 
causality
rather 
than 
a 
disconnectedness 
in 
the 
scientific 
mode
EOS
in 
the 
context 
of 
conventional 
historiography
foucault 
argues 
that 
the 
point 
is 
to 
analyse 
the 
different 
kinds 
of 
transformation
the 
complex 
play 
of 
dependencies
links 
and 
redistributions
rather 
than 
to 
provide 
yet 
another 
account 
of 
change
succession 
and 
its 
causes
EOS
the 
order 
of 
things 
although 
in 
many 
ways 
foucault
's 
most 
influential 
work
remains
however
an 
oddity 
in 
certain 
respects
first
that 
in 
arguing 
for 
an 
a 
priori 
common 
to 
a 
limited
number 
of 
knowledges
foucault 
at 
times 
seems 
to 
be 
advocating 
a 
structural 
key 
between 
different 
levels 
within 
the 
episteme 
thus 
restoring 
the 
form 
of 
the 
essential 
section 
so 
criticized 
by 
althusser
EOS
foucault 
has 
even 
been 
accused 
of 
returning
in 
this 
work
to 
the 
concept 
of 
a 
totality 
in 
the 
episteme 
it 
has 
certainly 
been 
somewhat 
hastily 
assumed 
that 
the 
latter 
can 
be 
appropriated 
more 
or 
less 
as 
a 
new 
way 
of 
describing 
a 
historical 
period
EOS
this 
fails 
to 
recognize
however
the 
extent 
to 
which 
it 
articulates 
only 
the 
structure 
of 
certain 
specific 
forms 
of 
knowledge 
rather 
than 
some 
single 
overarching 
principle
EOS
the 
constant 
emphasis 
on 
its 
being 
the 
western 
episteme 
suggests 
immediate 
problems 
for 
any 
assumption 
that 
it 
constitutes 
a 
totality
EOS
the 
episteme 
rather 
delineates 
what 
foucault 
calls 
a 
cluster 
of 
transformations
these
he 
suggests
enable 
the 
substitution 
of 
differentiated 
analyses 
for 
the 
themes 
of 
a 
totalising 
history
EOS
they 
allow 
us 
to 
describe
as 
the 
episteme 
of 
a 
period
not 
the 
sum 
of 
its 
knowledge
nor 
the 
general 
style 
of 
its 
research
but 
the 
deviation
distances
the 
oppositions
the 
differences
the 
relations 
of 
its 
multiple 
scientific 
discourses
the 
epistemic 
is 
not 
a 
sort 
of 
grand 
underlying 
theory 
it 
is 
a 
space 
of 
dispersion 
it 
is 
an 
open 
field 
of 
relationships 
and 
no 
doubt 
indefinitely 
specifiable 
EOS
they 
allow 
us 
furthermore 
to 
describe 
not 
the 
great 
history 
which 
would 
carry 
along 
all 
the 
sciences 
in 
a 
single 
trajectory
but 
the 
types 
of 
history 
that 
is 
to 
say
of 
retentivity 
and 
transformation 
which 
characterize 
different 
discourses
the 
episteme 
is 
not 
a 
slice 
of 
history 
common 
to 
all 
the 
sciences
it 
is 
a 
simultaneous 
play 
of 
specific 
remanences 
EOS
finally 
they 
allow 
us 
to 
situate 
the 
different 
thresholds 
in 
their 
respective 
place
for 
nothing 
proves 
in 
advance
that 
their 
chronology 
is 
the 
same 
for 
all 
types 
of 
discourse
EOS
the 
episteme 
is 
not 
a 
general 
stage 
of 
reason
it 
is 
a 
complex 
relationship 
of 
successive 
displacements
EOS
this 
is 
very 
different 
from 
the 
integral 
paradigms 
of 
thomas 
kuhn 
to 
which 
foucault
's 
epistemes 
are 
sometimes 
compared
EOS
but 
if 
the 
order 
of 
things 
is 
thus 
concerned 
to 
analyse 
ensembles 
of 
discourses
that 
do 
not 
form 
a 
totality
it 
does 
not 
focus 
on 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
such 
forms 
of 
knowledges 
relate 
to 
the 
institutions 
in 
which 
and 
through 
which 
they 
are 
produced
EOS
in 
the 
archaeology 
of 
knowledge 
foucault 
corrects 
this 
by 
addressing 
the 
difficulties 
of 
making 
knowledges 
intelligible 
as 
a 
part 
of 
their 
institutional
social 
and 
political 
practices

EOS
foucault
's 
distrust 
of 
conventional 
forms 
of 
history
as 
we 
have 
seen
is 
a 
consistent 
thread 
in 
his 
project
as 
is 
his 
insistence 
that 
his 
historical 
method 
is 
limited 
to 
addressing 
specific 
problems 
often 
comparable 
to 
those 
posed 
by 
the 
social 
sciences 
to 
historical 
documents 
and 
practices 
in 
order 
to 
make 
them 
intelligible
EOS
only 
once
however
does 
he 
devote 
a 
whole 
book 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
historical 
methodology
EOS
in 
the 
archaeology 
of 
knowledge 
he 
develops 
his 
suggestion 
in 
the 
order 
of 
things 
that 
an 
epistemological 
mutation 
is 
taking 
place 
today 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
very 
concept 
and 
methodology 
of 
history
EOS
the 
book 
is 
both 
an 
account 
of 
and 
an 
intervention 
in 
that 
process
veering 
between 
the 
descriptive 
and 
the 
prescriptive
EOS
it 
begins 
by 
delineating 
the 
epistemological 
shift
the 
old 
order 
could 
be 
termed 
history
a 
continuous 
and 
chronological 
historiography
including 
hegelianism 
and 
related 
forms 
of 
marxism
with 
its 
philosophies 
of 
history
its 
assumptions 
of 
a 
rational
progressive 
and 
teleological 
historical 
development
its 
desire 
to 
discover 
a 
meaning 
in 
history
its 
questioning 
of 
the 
relativity 
of 
historical 
knowledge
and 
its 
use 
of 
categories

as

against 
this 
foucault

analyses 
long 
continuities

EOS
foucault 
notes 
that
at 
the 
same 
time 
as 
the 
annales 
school 
and 
others 
were 
constructing 
a 
history 
according 
to 
the 
long 
durÃ©e 
in 
the 
history 
of 
science
philosophy
and 
literature
attention 
was 
turning 
in 
exactly 
the 
opposite 
direction
that 
is 
away 
from 
vast 
unities 
towards 
phenomena 
of 
rupture
discontinuity
displacement 
and 
transformation
towards 
different 
temporalities 
as 
well 
as 
architectonic 
unities
EOS
here 
he 
instances 
in 
particular 
the 
work 
of 
bachelard
canguilhem
serres
guÃ©roult
and 
althusser
EOS
he 
argues 
that
given 
the 
proliferation 
of 
both 
discontinuities 
and 
long 
periods
the 
problem 
is 
now 
to 
constitute 
the 
series
its 
elements
its 
limits
and 
its 
relation 
to 
other 
series
EOS
in 
other 
words
rather 
than 
set 
these 
antithetical 
approaches 
against 
each 
other 
as 
one 
might 
have 
expected
foucault 
suggests 
that 
they 
are 
part 
of 
the 
same 
mutation
EOS
foucault 
characterizes 
this 
epistemic 
shift 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
difference 
between 
what 
he 
calls 
total
and 
general
history
or
history 
and 
archaeology
EOS
he 
explains 
this 
as 
follows
EOS
total

whereas

between

whereas

draws 
everything

according

a

EOS
total 
history 
seeks 
to 
reconstitute 
the 
overall 
form 
of 
a 
society 
according 
to 
some 
fundamental 
principle
law
or 
form
be 
it 
metaphysical 
or 
material
while 
general 
history 
despite 
its 
name 
is 
by 
no 
means 
concerned 
to 
produce 
a 
general 
theory 
of 
history
nor 
even 
a 
cohesive 
or 
comprehensive 
view
but 
rather 
to 
conduct 
a 
historical 
investigation 
according 
to 
particular 
problems
opening 
up 
a 
field 
in 
which 
one 
could 
describe 
the 
singularity 
of 
practices
the 
play 
of 
their 
relations
EOS
foucault 
specifies 
the 
difference 
between 
them 
by 
contrasting 
their 
relation 
to 
the 
document
the 
historians 
of 
total 
history 
have 
been 
engaged 
above 
all 
in 
the 
interpretation 
of 
documents
attempting 
to 
reconstitute 
the 
past
to 
give 
it 
an 
inner 
meaning 
always 
available 
only 
to 
the 
historian
to 
recover 
a 
voice 
and 
allow 
it 
to 
speak
EOS
the 
historians 
of 
a 
general 
history
on 
the 
other 
hand
reject 
interpretation 
as 
such 
in 
favour 
of 
making 
the 
evidence 
of 
documents 
intelligible 
by 
posing 
questions 
to 
them
constituting 
through 
such 
questions 
what 
counts 
as 
the 
series 
of 
historical 
events
its 
elements
its 
limits
and 
its 
relation 
to 
other 
series
or 
what 
rules 
operated 
for 
particular 
discursive 
practices
EOS
this 
stress 
on 
intelligibility 
is 
a 
useful 
corrective 
to 
the 
widespread 
current 
assumption 
for 
which 
foucault 
himself 
is 
also 
partly 
responsible 
that 
history 
is 
just 
another 
form 
of 
interpretation
EOS
unexpectedly
perhaps
foucault 
traces 
the 
beginnings 
of 
this 
epistemic 
mutation 
in 
the 
thinking 
of 
history 
to 
marx
EOS
this 
implies 
a 
challenge 
that 
contemporary 
marxism 
has 
yet 
to 
address
EOS
as 
we 
have 
seen
for 
some  
foucault 
can 
apparently 
be 
dismissed 
with 
ease 
as 
merely 
the 
philosopher 
of 
discontinuity
a 
description 
which 
is 
hardly 
adequate
for 
others
criticism 
takes 
the 
form 
that 
he 
simply 
relativizes 
history
but 
this 
is 
really 
no 
better
for 
history 
is 
itself 
a 
mode 
of 
demonstrating 
the 
relativity
temporariness
and 
temporality 
of 
phenomena
EOS
unless 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
prove 
the 
identification 
of 
history 
with 
truth
as 
sartre 
tried 
to 
do
then 
the 
claim 
that 
a 
single 
univocal 
history 
is 
not 
relative 
only 
works 
by 
removing 
all 
other 
elements 
in 
the 
set 
to 
which 
it 
could 
be 
compared
thus 
making 
a 
set 
of 
one
EOS
effectively
however
all 
this 
does 
is 
to 
turn 
all 
history 
into 
a 
single 
event 
which
paradoxically
dehistoricizes 
it
EOS
what 
has 
not 
been 
adequately 
considered 
is 
foucault
's 
characterization 
of 
an 
epistemological 
shift 
within 
the 
theorization 
of 
history 
itself
EOS
he 
suggests 
not 
only 
that 
it 
begins 
with 
marx 
but 
that 
he 
himself 
forms 
part 
of 
this 
mutation
which 
means 
that
according 
to 
his 
argument
in 
order 
to 
dismiss 
him 
you 
would 
have 
to 
dismiss 
marx 
also
EOS
foucault 
thus 
does 
not 
merely 
set 
up 
an 
alternative 
history
but 
contends 
that 
that 
alternative 
is 
part 
of 
a 
displacement 
that 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
replacing 
the 
history 
that 
preceded 
it
EOS
it 
is 
therefore 
necessary 
to 
address 
not 
only 
his 
theoretical 
and 
methodological 
but 
also 
his 
historical 
arguments 
something 
that 
his 
critics 
have 
singularly 
failed 
to 
do
EOS
the 
archaeology 
of 
knowledge 
thus 
analyses 
the 
shift 
in 
historiography 
of 
which 
foucault 
himself 
is 
the 
most 
powerful 
contemporary 
representative
EOS
as 
epistemic 
breaks 
go
however
it 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
slow 
one
foucault 
attributes 
its 
hesitancy 
to 
a 
fundamental 
reluctance 
to 
think 
difference 
rather 
than 
the 
reassuring 
form 
of 
the 
identical
it 
is
he 
comments
as 
if 
we 
were 
afraid 
to 
conceive 
of 
the 
other 
in 
the 
time 
of 
our 
own 
thought
EOS
here 
we 
encounter 
the 
continuing 
dominance 
of 
the 
philosophy 
of 
the 
subject
which
according 
to 
foucault
was 
specifically 
introduced 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
a 
shelter 
for 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
consciousness
against 
the 
intrusion 
of 
heterogeneity
EOS
continuous 
history 
and 
the 
subject 
are 
thus 
dependent 
on 
each 
other
EOS
instead 
of 
centring 
his 
analyses 
on 
the 
knowledge 
derived 
from 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
subject
foucault 
investigates 
the 
conditions 
of 
emergence 
of 
the 
subject 
as 
the 
basis 
of 
knowledge
he 
argues 
that 
at 
the 
same 
time 
as 
it 
was 
widely 
proposed 
as 
the 
one 
saving 
good 
of 
human 
civilization 
it 
also 
facilitated 
a 
more 
sinister 
operation
EOS
just 
as 
history 
involved 
the 
legitimation 
as 
knowledge 
of 
certain 
forms 
of 
political 
power
so 
the 
production 
of 
the 
subject 
by 
the 
human 
sciences 
as 
an 
object 
of 
knowledge 
also 
enabled 
a 
new 
form 
of 
political 
control
the 
individual 
is 
not 
a 
pre-given 
entity 
which 
is 
seized 
on 
by 
the 
exercise 
of 
power
EOS
the 
individual
with 
his 
identity 
and 
characteristics
is 
the 
product 
of 
a 
relation 
of 
power 
exercised 
over 
bodies
EOS
in 
discipline 
and 
punish 
foucault 
demonstrates 
how 
the 
individual 
is 
constituted 
through 
specific 
technologies 
of 
power
in 
the 
history 
of 
sexuality 
he 
shows 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
human 
sciences
including 
medicine 
and 
the 
practice 
of 
psychoanalysis
facilitated 
the 
extension 
of 
control 
beyond 
the 
limits 
of 
the 
body 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
inner 
realms 
of 
subjectivity
consciousness 
and 
experience
EOS
foucault 
argues 
that 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
movements 
since 
the 
nineteenth 
century
including 
various 
anthropologizing 
marxisms
have 
developed 
complicitly 
with 
this 
so 
as 
to 
preserve 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
the 
subject 
against 
marx

and 
others
' 
decentrings
positivism
the 
hegelian 
marxism 
of

the

of

as 
well 
as 
various 
theories 
of 
cultural 
totalities 
such 
as 
that 
of 
the 
frankfurt 
school
EOS
dispensing 
with 
the 
subject 
necessarily 
also 
means 
the 
end 
of 
the 
use 
of 
the 
category 
of 
ideology
in 
this 
context 
foucault
's 
later 
work 
counters 
althusser
's 
influential 
essay 
on 
ideological 
state 
apparatuses
EOS
many 
of 
those 
now 
hostile 
to 
althusser 
continue 
to 
endorse 
this 
essay
which 
offers 
a 
theory 
of 
institutional 
power 
dependent 
on 
the 
categories 
of 
the 
subject 
and 
ideology
EOS
foucault 
is 
critical 
of 
such 
a 
theory 
not 
just 
because 
it 
is 
based 
on 
a 
science/non-science 
distinction 
which 
for 
him 
is 
simply 
the 
product 
of 
a 
particular 
discursive 
formation 
which 
claims 
access 
to 
the 
real
rather 
than 
involving 
any 
epistemological 
questions 
of 
truth 
or 
objectivity
but 
also 
because 
it 
produces 
the 
notion 
of 
ideology 
as 
a 
secondary 
mediation 
as 
in 
althusser
's 
interpellation
in 
an 
inside/outside 
structure 
between 
the 
determinants 
of 
power 
and 
the 
individual 
subject
EOS
for 
foucault
the 
tendency 
of 
theories 
of 
ideology 
to 
entrammel 
themselves 
in 
the 
categories 
of 
psychoanalysis
even 
with 
the 
eternal 
in 
althusser
's 
case
means 
that 
they 
themselves 
begin 
to 
utilize 
the 
very 
procedures 
of 
individuation 
that 
they 
ought 
to 
have 
been 
analysing
EOS
the 
questions 
of 
the 
subject 
and 
of 
ideology 
raise 
as 
their 
corollary 
the 
problem 
of 
what 
position 
of 
enunciation 
the 
historian 
can 
claim 
in 
relation 
to 
his 
or 
her 
own 
work
EOS
foucault 
is 
particularly 
critical 
of 
the 
appropriating 
structure 
of 
totalization
marxist 
or 
otherwise
insofar 
as 
it 
implies 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
theorist 
who 
produces 
the 
totalization 
of 
knowledge
in 
the 
same 
way
he 
distrusts 
the 
use 
of 
history 
as 
an 
encompassing 
framework 
because 
it 
works 
as 
a 
power 
structure 
that 
enables 
the 
expropriation 
and 
control 
of 
the 
past 
according 
to 
the 
perspective 
and 
truth 
of 
the 
present
EOS
it 
elides 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
historian 
will 
always 
also 
be 
historically 
located 
and 
therefore 
can
not 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
produce 
a 
final 
totalization
a 
dialectical 
situation 
anticipated 
by 
sartre
EOS
foucault 
argues 
that 
just 
as 
there 
can 
be 
no 
general 
theory 
of 
history
but 
only 
particular 
answers 
to 
particular 
questions 
which 
make 
individual 
practices 
intelligible
so 
the 
intellectual 
can 
best 
hope 
to 
be 
specific 
rather 
than 
universal 
universal 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
proposing 
transcendent 
values
systems
totalities
narratives 
or 
teleologies
EOS
this 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
the 
intellectual 
therefore 
nihilistically 
celebrates 
dispersion
fragmentation 
or 
relativity
rather 
she 
or 
he 
is 
the 
person 
who
facing 
such 
dispersion 
but 
without 
conceding 
to 
the 
nostalgic 
desire 
for 
totalization
poses 
the 
questions 
and 
constitutes 
the 
series 
and 
continuities 
for 
analysis 
and 
thus 
for 
transformation 
while 
attempting 
to 
respect 
its 
heterogeneity
EOS
this 
suggests 
why
contrary 
to 
the 
way 
in 
which 
certain 
commentators 
tend 
to 
represent 
them
it 
is 
clear 
that 
for 
foucault
as 
for 
lyotard 
or 
derrida
total 
fragmentation 
would 
be 
as 
counter-productive 
and 
as 
impossible 
as 
total 
synthesis
EOS
as 
gayatri 
chakravorty 
spivak 
puts 
it
theoretical 
descriptions 
can
not 
produce 
universals
EOS
they 
can 
only 
ever 
produce 
provisional 
generalizations
even 
as 
the 
theorist 
realizes 
the 
crucial 
importance 
of 
their 
persistent 
production
EOS
such 
arguments 
will 
have 
no 
pretensions
by 
definition
to 
knowledge-claims 
that 
affect 
to 
rise 
above 
the 
historical 
conditions 
in 
which 
they 
are 
made
EOS
iv 
history 
and 
the 
event
EOS
despite 
his 
programmatic 
emphasis 
in 
the 
archaeology 
on 
the 
discursive 
formation 
as 
a 
means 
of 
making 
intelligible 
those 
knowledges 
that 
are 
formulated 
through 
their 
institutional 
components
foucault 
turned 
away 
from 
this 
kind 
of 
historical 
enquiry 
because 
it 
was 
too 
clean
conceptually 
aseptic
in 
other 
words
too 
apolitical
EOS
foucault 
therefore 
abandons 
analysis 
of 
epistemes 
for 
the 
more 
nietzschean 
genealogy
which 
allows 
him 
to 
articulate 
conflict 
in 
terms 
of 
differentiated 
histories 
with 
their 
own 
conceptual 
specificities 
and 
their 
own 
times
while 
retaining 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
formulation 
of 
aims 
and 
intentions
EOS
i 
would 
call 
genealogy
a 
form 
of 
history 
which 
can 
account 
for 
the 
constitution 
of 
knowledges
discourses
domains 
of 
objects 
etc.
without 
having 
to 
make 
reference 
to 
a 
subject 
which 
is 
either 
transcendental 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
field 
of 
events 
or 
runs 
in 
its 
empty 
sameness 
throughout 
the 
course 
of 
history
EOS
genealogy 
develops 
the 
possibility 
broached 
in 
the 
archaeology 
that 
in 
a 
general 
history 
different 
significances 
can 
be 
accorded 
to 
events
depending 
on
their 
correlation 
with 
other 
previous 
or 
simultaneous 
events
discursive 
or 
not
EOS
here 
it 
is 
the 
problem 
the 
historian 
poses 
that 
determines 
what 
constitutes 
an 
event 
and 
what 
status 
it 
has
EOS
foucault
's 
genealogy 
means 
that 
by 
asking 
a 
question
posing 
a 
problem
you 
set 
up 
a 
generality 
against 
which 
you 
constitute 
events 
and 
arrange 
them 
in 
a 
series
EOS
the 
construction 
of 
that 
generality 
does 
not 
pretend 
to 
be 
the 
only 
possible 
one 
the 
same 
event 
could 
operate 
in 
all 
sorts 
of 
different 
ways 
in 
different 
series
temporalities
which 
would 
mean 
that
strictly 
speaking
it 
was 
no 
longer 
the 
same 
event
for 
it 
would 
have 
been 
dispersed 
in 
their 
different 
rarefactions
EOS
this 
is 
not 
supposed 
to 
suggest 
that 
events 
can
not 
be 
said 
to 
occur 
straightforwardly 
in 
the 
real 
but 
rather 
that 
when 
set 
up 
in 
any 
series
narrative
or 
history 
they 
are 
constructed 
as 
such 
events 
retrospectively 
by 
the 
historian
EOS
if 
all 
history 
attempts 
to 
conceptualize 
the 
event
to 
wean 
it 
from 
its 
finitude
then 
foucault 
like 
many 
of 
his 
contemporaries 
is 
concerned 
to  
respect 
its 
singularity
EOS
in 
the 
essay 
theatum 
philosophicum
1970
written 
shortly 
after 
the 
archaeology 
foucault 
attempts 
to 
avoid 
the 
snares 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
event 
to 
the 
totality
or 
the 
particular 
to 
the 
general
that 
beset 
both 
sartre 
and 
althusser
by 
arguing 
that 
the 
event 
as 
event 
is 
only 
constituted 
through 
its 
repetition 
in 
thought 
as 
a 
phantasm
it 
makes 
the 
event 
indefinite 
so 
that 
it 
repeats 
itself 
as 
a 
singular 
universal
EOS
this 
argument
which 
foucault 
derives 
from 
deleuze
although 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
tellingly 
invokes 
sartre
's 
theoretical 
formulation 
designed 
to 
solve 
exactly 
the 
same 
problem
provides 
a 
way 
of 
avoiding 
the 
incommensurability 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
event 
to 
the 
concept 
by 
allowing 
the 
disjunctive 
affirmation 
of 
both
thus 
solving 
the 
problem 
that 
the 
concept
as 
a 
part 
of 
the 
language 
of 
generality
will 
inevitably 
travesty 
the

EOS

neglected 
for 
many 
centuries
the

assimilated 
in 
a 
concept
from

vainly 
attempted 
to 
extract 
it 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
fact 
verifying 
a 
proposition
of

a 
modality

the

be 
hard 
to 
see 
it 
as 
that 
important
EOS
foucault
's 
gesture
however
marks 
the 
radical 
scope 
of 
such 
an 
anti-essentialist 
project 
which 
exploits 
plato
's 
admission 
that 
there 
can 
not 
only 
be 
a 
good 
copy 
but 
also 
a 
bad 
one 
phantasma
characteristic 
of 
the 
secondary 
representations 
of 
the 
poets
EOS
deleuze 
reverses 
plato 
by 
validating 
this 
simulacrum 
of 
the 
good 
copy 
on 
the 
grounds 
that
precisely 
because 
it 
is 
a 
bad 
copy
it 
breaks 
down 
all 
adequation 
between 
copy 
and 
model
appearance 
and 
essence
event 
and 
idea
EOS
as 
plato 
realized
it 
is 
dangerous 
because 
its 
effect 
is 
to 
dethrone 
the 
idea 
from 
its 
position 
of 
truth
EOS
moreover
because 
the 
bad 
copy 
by 
definition 
can
not 
claim 
to 
be 
copying 
anything 
but 
itself
it 
creates 
its 
original
retroactively
so 
that 
the 
copy 
precedes 
the 
original 
in 
a 
ghostly 
originary 
repetition
EOS
descombes 
describes 
a 
comparable 
paradoxical 
structure 
in 
his 
account 
of 
originary 
delay
a 
first 
event 
can
not 
be 
the 
first 
event 
if 
it 
is 
the 
only 
event
it 
can
not 
be 
said 
to 
be 
a 
first 
until 
it 
is 
followed 
by 
a 
second
which 
then 
retrospectively 
constitutes 
it 
as 
the 
first 
which 
means 
that 
its 
firstness 
hovers 
over 
it 
as 
its 
meaning 
without 
being 
identifiable 
with 
it 
as 
such
EOS
thus
the 
phantasm
rather 
than 
constituting 
the 
event
hovers 
over 
its 
surface 
like 
a 
cloud
as 
an 
effect 
of 
meaning 
not 
identifiable 
with 
anything 
in 
the 
event 
as 
such
EOS
deleuze
's 
best-known 
example 
of 
how 
this 
works 
is 
the 
battle
where
he 
asks
is 
the 
battle
EOS
what 
we 
call 
a 
battle 
consists 
of 
a 
vast
heterogeneous 
array 
of 
individual 
actions 
in 
the 
field 
fighting
firing
charging
wounding 
none 
of 
which 
constitutes 
the 
battle
as 
such
EOS
the 
battle
hovers 
over 
the 
individual 
actions 
like 
in 
incorporeal 
cloud
distinct 
from 
them
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
making 
up 
a 
surface 
of 
their 
meaning-effect
a 
simulacrum 
that 
brings 
the 
event 
into 
being 
at 
the 
moment 
when 
language 
and 
event 
coincide
EOS
foucault 
recognizes 
in 
deleuze
's 
account 
of 
events 
as 
singularities
points 
or 
intensities 
on 
a 
surface 
ready 
to 
be 
actualized 
in 
any 
particular 
form 
or 
meaning
the 
potential 
for 
pushing 
further 
his 
own 
notion 
of 
history 
as 
a 
genealogical 
series
EOS
such 
genealogy 
works 
by 
repeating 
the 
non
event
as 
an 
event
in 
thought 
in 
a 
structure 
comparable 
to 
freud
's 
deferred 
action
or 
retroactivity
EOS
no 
more 
than 
the 
latter 
does 
it 
seek 
to 
lay 
claim 
to 
the 
real
or 
truth 
as 
such
EOS
foucault 
inflects 
this 
model 
by 
focusing 
on 
the 
possibility 
of 
constructing 
the 
series 
so 
as 
to 
repeat 
the 
disruption 
and 
discontinuity 
of 
the 
non-original
event
EOS
in 
freud
the 
point 
is 
similarly 
not 
just 
the 
question 
on 
which 
most 
attention 
gets 
focused 
of 
whether 
the 
event 
really
happened 
a 
good 
copy
or 
was 
subsequently 
fantasized 
by 
the 
experiencing 
subject 
a 
bad 
copy
but 
rather 
that 
it 
is 
repeated 
as 
a 
disruptive 
event 
that 
fissures 
ordinary 
forms 
of 
psychic 
continuity 
and 
therefore 
gains 
analytic 
attention 
in 
the 
present
EOS
the 
same 
structure 
can 
be 
utilized 
by 
the 
historian 
so 
that 
the 
writing 
of 
history 
can 
itself 
become 
a 
disruptive 
event 
and 
consequently 
a 
form 
of 
political 
intervention
EOS
v 
foucault
's 
phantasms
EOS
if 
foucault 
proposes 
the 
philosophy 
of 
the 
phantasm 
as 
a 
way 
for 
the 
historian 
to 
produce 
the 
meaning-effect 
of 
the 
event 
while 
still 
doing 
justice 
to 
its 
singularity
it 
also 
offers 
a 
way 
of 
thinking 
through 
some 
of 
the 
paradoxes 
that 
we 
have 
encountered 
in 
the 
problematic 
conceptualization 
of 
history
EOS
from 
sartre 
to 
foucault 
history 
has 
repeatedly 
emerged 
as 
a 
contradictory 
concept
both 
totalizing 
and 
detotalizing
essentialist 
and 
non-essentialist
EOS
such 
contradictions 
can 
be 
productive
the 
attempt 
to 
reject 
historicism 
absolutely 
results 
either 
in 
an 
utter 
particularism 
or 
in 
a 
surreptitious 
return 
of 
historicism 
in 
a 
different 
form
EOS
only 
an 
understanding 
that 
recognizes 
that 
an 
irresolvable 
tension 
works 
within 
the 
historical 
schema 
itself 
will 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
make 
its 
contradictory 
claims 
productive
EOS
this 
possibility 
is 
outlined 
by 
foucault 
himself 
as 
early 
as 
the 
order 
of 
things 
EOS
he 
comments
EOS
the 
more 
history 
attempts 
to 
transcend 
its 
own 
rootedness 
in 
historicity
and 
the 
greater 
the 
efforts 
it 
makes 
to 
attain
beyond 
the 
historical 
relativity 
of 
its 
origin 
and 
its 
choices
the 
sphere 
of 
universality
the 
more 
clearly 
it 
bears 
the 
marks 
of 
its 
historical 
birth
and 
the 
more 
evidently 
there 
appears 
through 
it 
the 
history 
of 
which 
it 
is 
itself 
a 
part
inversely
the 
more 
it 
accepts 
its 
relativity
and 
the 
more 
deeply 
it 
sinks 
into 
the 
movement 
it 
shares 
with 
what 
it 
is 
recounting
then 
the 
more 
it 
tends 
to  
the 
slenderness 
of 
the 
narrative
and 
all 
the 
positive 
content 
it 
obtained 
for 
itself 
through 
the 
human 
sciences 
is 
dissipated
EOS

EOS
history 
becomes 
the 
impossibility 
between 
this 
scylla 
and 
charybdis 
in 
lyotard
's 
terms
it 
contains 
within 
its 
own 
project 
an 
incommensurable 
difference 
EOS
it 
can 
only 
be 
described 
in 
terms 
of 
its 
organization 
according 
to 
an 
economy 
of 
logical 
tensions 
or 
strictures
of 
demands 
and 
constraints
EOS
it 
is
as 
derrida 
comments
a 
question 
of 
showing
EOS
that 
history 
is 
impossible
meaningless
in 
the 
finite 
totality
and 
that 
it 
is 
impossible
meaningless
in 
the 
positive 
and 
actual 
infinity
that 
history 
keeps 
to 
the 
difference 
between 
totality 
and 
infinity
EOS
thus 
both 
historicism 
or 
entirely 
differentiated 
histories 
are 
in 
themselves 
impossibilities
history 
will 
always 
involve 
a 
form 
of 
historicism
but 
a 
historicism 
that 
can
not 
be 
sustained
EOS
it 
is 
thus 
a 
contradictory 
quasi
concept 
a 
phantasm 
in 
which 
neither 
the 
elements 
of 
totalization 
nor 
difference 
can 
be 
definitively 
achieved 
or 
dispatched
EOS
this 
means 
that 
history 
can 
be 
theorized 
not 
so 
much 
as 
a 
contradictory 
process 
but 
as 
a 
concept 
that 
must 
enact 
its 
own 
contradiction 
with 
itself
this 
difference 
is 
what 
is 
called 
history 
EOS
in 
this 
context
we 
may 
recall 
that 
althusser
rather 
than 
simply 
criticizing 
the 
notion 
of 
history 
as 
a 
totality 
as 
foucault 
often 
tended 
to 
do
argued 
for 
the 
rearticulation 
of 
different 
histories 
within 
a 
decentred 
totality
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
history 
can
not 
do 
without 
one
EOS
was 
it 
simply 
incoherence 
on 
his 
part 
when 
he 
suggested 
that 
his 
science 
of 
history
even 
though 
it 
allows 
for 
differentiated 
histories
still 
demands 
to 
be 
considered 
within 
a 
general 
concept 
of 
history
EOS
we 
have 
seen 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
sartre
's 
critique 
shows 
how 
totalization 
can
not 
work 
without 
a 
movement 
of 
self-transcendence
a 
repeated 
interpolation 
of 
an 
excess 
beyond 
the 
totality 
which 
paradoxically 
then 
means 
that 
the 
totality 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
a 
totality
EOS
although 
sartre
's 
inability 
to 
effect 
self-totalization 
is 
often 
presented 
as 
a 
failure
the 
movement 
of 
history 
that 
he 
describes 
is 
increasingly 
enacted 
through 
his 
own 
writing
EOS
such 
a 
shift 
is 
not 
immediately 
discernible 
in 
foucault
EOS
his 
deleuzian 
notion 
of 
the 
phantasmatic 
event 
constituted 
a 
brief 
attempt 
to 
reformulate 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
particular 
to 
the 
general 
as 
a 
problem 
of 
history
EOS
but 
he 
made 
little 
effort 
to 
develop 
this 
outside 
his 
own 
definitions 
of 
the 
genealogical 
method
while 
his 
shift 
into 
the 
problematics 
of 
power 
seemed 
to 
lead 
him 
into 
a 
labyrinth 
from 
which 
it 
was 
virtually 
impossible 
to 
extract 
himself
EOS
the 
philosophy 
of 
the 
phantasm 
may
however
help 
us 
to 
do 
justice 
to 
the 
event 
of 
foucault 
himself
EOS
one 
of 
the 
oddities 
of 
foucault
's 
work 
is 
that 
it 
seems 
riven 
by 
an 
internal 
tension 
for 
example
as 
peter 
dews 
notes
while 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
foucault 
lays 
claims 
to 
a 
form 
of 
objectivity 
in 
his 
archaeology
and 
eschews 
interpretation 
in 
favour 
of 
intelligibility
on 
the  
other 
hand 
throughout 
his 
life 
he 
was 
also 
prone 
to 
endorse 
a 
nietzschean 
insistence 
on 
the 
interminability 
of 
interpretation
EOS
for 
dews 
this 
equivocation 
over 
the 
epistemological 
status 
of 
his 
own 
discourse 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
an 
uncontrollable 
oscillation
the 
shifting 
perspectives 
of 
foucault
's 
work
he 
writes
do 
powerfully 
illuminate
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
fall 
victim 
to
the 
contradictory 
processes 
which 
they 
address
EOS
but 
such 
a 
self-undermining 
of 
the 
epistemological 
status 
of 
his 
own 
work 
is 
also 
characteristic 
of 
lacan
and 
of 
freud 
indeed
dews 
argues 
that 
this 
constitutes 
freud
's 
greatest 
strength
EOS
we 
might 
therefore 
wonder 
whether 
its 
appearance 
in 
foucault
far 
from 
being 
the 
result 
of 
theoretical 
ineptitude
does 
not 
involve 
simulacra
or 
ghostly 
bad 
copies
similarly 
designed 
to 
undermine 
the 
claims 
of 
theoretical 
mastery
and 
to 
produce 
in 
his 
texts 
surface-effects 
of 
the 
kind 
of 
heterogeneity 
we 
might 
expect 
from 
someone 
who 
had 
contested 
the 
unifying 
function 
of 
the 
author
EOS
with 
respect 
to 
history
the 
vacillations 
of 
foucault
's 
writing 
enact 
the 
impossibility 
of 
its 
simultaneous 
finitude 
and 
infinitude
the 
irresolvable 
conflict 
between 
history 
as 
meaning 
and 
history 
as 
difference
between 
history 
as 
a 
teleology 
and 
eschatology 
and 
history 
as 
the 
event
as 
finitude 
and 
mortality
EOS
here 
we 
once 
more 
encounter 
the 
recognition 
that 
at 
a 
conceptual 
level 
the 
idea 
of 
history 
can
not 
be 
taken 
further
rather 
it 
can 
only 
be 
addressed 
through 
a 
tension 
in 
the 
writing 
itself
EOS
the 
early 
opposition 
between 
writing 
and 
history 
which 
enabled 
a 
critique 
from 
an 
outer 
limit 
has 
thus 
been 
replaced 
by 
a 
dissension 
within 
foucault
's 
own 
discursive 
practice
EOS
instead 
of 
locating 
the 
other 
elsewhere 
in 
the 
transgressive 
writing 
of 
literature 
or 
madness
foucault 
himself 
becomes 
plato
's 
banished 
poet
and 
enacts 
in 
his 
language 
a 
supplementary 
simulacrum 
of 
the 
delirium 
of 
history
EOS
as 
maurice 
blanchot 
has 
put 
it
and 
were 
not 
his 
own 
principles 
more 
complex 
than 
his 
official 
discourse
with 
its 
striking 
formulations
led 
one 
to 
think
EOS
vi 
history 
as 
power
EOS
in 
later 
work 
foucault 
veers 
away 
from 
his 
most 
radical 
philosophical 
insights 
towards 
an 
analysis 
of 
discursive 
and 
extra-discursive 
systems 
of 
domination 
and 
exploitation
with 
increasing 
focus 
on 
the 
apparently 
more 
political 
question 
of 
power
EOS
but 
perhaps 
this 
shift 
is 
not 
so 
distinct
for 
the 
interaction 
of 
power 
and 
resistance
which 
mimes 
the 
mutual 
contamination 
and 
transmutation 
of 
freud
's 
death-drive 
and 
pleasure 
principle
also 
operates 
is 
a 
simulacrum 
of 
the 
ungraspable
vacillating 
manoeuvres 
of 
foucault
's 
formulations 
of 
history
EOS
whereas 
foucault 
was 
inclined 
to 
remark 
that 
in 
retrospect 
he 
considered 
that 
all 
his 
work 
had 
been 
about 
power
it 
seems 
almost 
equally 
possible 
that 
his 
analyses 
of 
power 
constitute 
a 
continuing 
meditation 
on 
the 
phantasm
EOS
although 
in 
no 
sense 
a 
general 
theory
foucault
's 
notion 
of 
power 
reformulates 
the 
problem 
of 
agency 
and 
determinism 
which 
had 
beset 
sartre 
and 
many 
others 
by 
focusing 
on 
the  
possibility 
of 
making 
intelligible 
the 
strategies 
and 
techniques 
of 
local 
operations 
of 
power 
without 
relying 
on 
the 
dialectic 
of 
ideology 
and 
the 
consciousness 
of 
subjects
or 
on 
their 
corollary
the 
assumption 
that 
power 
operates 
globally 
and 
homogeneously
EOS
the 
absence 
of 
the 
category 
of 
consciousness 
inevitably 
plays 
down 
the 
role 
of 
individual 
subjects 
and 
thus 
of 
individual 
agency 
and 
resistance 
as 
a 
result 
of 
specific 
acts 
of 
will
EOS
if 
this 
causes 
difficulties 
for 
some
foucault
's 
scepticism 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
tendency 
to 
inflate 
the 
effect 
of 
individual 
agency 
can 
only 
be 
compared 
to 
the 
position 
of 
many 
marxisms 
in 
which 
resistance 
and 
revolution 
are 
hardly 
the 
privilege 
of 
the 
individual 
as 
such
but 
rather 
of 
collective 
class 
action
EOS
those 
who 
forget 
the 
virtues 
of 
solidarity 
in 
order 
to 
protest 
against 
the 
downgrading 
of 
individual 
agency 
might 
recall 
that 
it 
has 
been 
intellectuals 
who 
have 
been 
most 
prone 
to 
inflate 
the 
significance 
of 
individuals 
particularly 
intellectuals 
to 
the 
same 
degree 
that 
their 
theories 
propose 
universal 
categories 
and 
claim 
universal 
effects
EOS
moreover 
the 
exclusive 
focus 
on 
resistance
as 
a 
privileged 
political 
category 
is 
itself 
open 
to 
question
EOS
as 
with 
his 
genealogical 
history
foucault
's 
meditations 
on 
power 
are 
not 
themselves 
without 
problems
but 
reactions 
to 
them 
can 
also 
be 
too 
hastily 
dismissive
often 
because 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
they 
are 
proposed 
as 
a 
general 
theory
EOS
for 
example
after 
the 
history 
of 
sexuality 
much 
has 
been 
made 
of 
foucault
's 
analysis 
of 
power 
as 
a 
form 
of 
totalizing 
paranoia
but 
the 
analyses 
in 
that 
book
of
for 
example 
the 
shift 
from 
the 
catholic 
confession 
box 
to 
the 
confessional 
psychoanalytic 
couch
are 
both 
culturally 
and 
historically 
specific
and 
foucault
's 
remarks 
about 
them 
need 
to 
be 
put 
in 
the 
same 
perspective
EOS
after 
all
if 
the 
system
really 
was 
bent 
upon 
the 
form 
of 
totalizing 
control 
that 
according 
to 
foucault 
psychoanalysis
for 
example
enables
it 
is 
worth 
recalling 
that 
psychoanalysis 
has 
never 
been 
adopted 
by 
the 
state 
as 
such 
and 
that 
its 
activities 
remain 
confined 
to 
a 
few 
very 
limited 
districts 
in 
a 
handful 
of 
prosperous 
cities 
round 
the 
world
EOS
similarly
those 
who 
claim 
that 
foucault 
removes 
the 
possibility 
of 
resistance 
as 
such 
miss 
the 
point
all 
that 
he 
downgrades 
is 
a 
theory 
of 
resistance 
centred 
on 
the 
individual 
subject 
as 
sovereign 
agent
EOS
he 
argues 
that 
to 
focus 
analysis 
in 
this 
way 
neglects 
the 
disciplinary 
forms 
and 
technologies 
through 
which 
power 
operates
EOS
the 
claim 
for 
a 
straightforward 
oppositional 
kind 
of 
resistance 
also 
assumes 
that 
subjects 
can 
resist 
from 
a 
position 
outside 
the 
operations 
of 
power
according 
to 
the 
dominant 
inside/outside 
model 
of 
conventional 
politics
EOS
this 
is 
the 
context 
in 
which 
to 
place 
foucault
's 
own 
recognition 
after 
derrida
's 
critique 
that 
he 
could 
no 
longer 
postulate 
madness 
or 
the 
other 
as 
outside
after 
which 
he 
maintained 
that 
the 
other 
is 
also 
always 
inside
he 
formulates 
the 
structures 
of 
power 
in 
exactly 
the 
same 
way
so 
that 
the 
forces 
of 
domination 
and 
resistance 
are 
caught 
up
sometimes 
indistinguishably
within 
each 
other
EOS
acts 
of 
resistance 
may 
of 
course 
continue 
to 
be 
initiated 
through 
individual 
acts 
of 
will
but 
as 
for 
sartre  
there 
is 
no 
guarantee 
that 
they 
will 
produce 
intended 
effects
EOS
an 
awareness 
of 
this 
structure 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
strategic 
intervention 
is 
either 
useless 
or 
impossible
but 
it 
does 
mean 
that 
analysis 
of 
how 
resistance 
actually 
operates
in 
what 
conditions 
it 
succeeds 
or 
fails
needs 
an 
altogether 
more 
complex 
model
EOS
foucault
's 
account 
of 
power 
is 
thus 
difficult 
to 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
he 
argues 
that 
the 
exercise 
and 
resistance 
of 
power 
work 
in 
a 
disruptive 
rather 
than 
a 
dialectical 
relation 
to 
each 
other
suggesting 
that 
points 
of 
resistance 
are 
present 
everywhere 
in 
the 
power 
network
EOS
where 
there 
is 
power
there 
is 
resistance
contrary 
to 
what 
is 
often 
assumed
it 
is 
the 
absence 
of 
resistance 
which 
is 
impossible
EOS
power 
is 
a 
two-way 
process
EOS
just 
as 
the 
exercise 
of 
power 
is 
heterogeneous
so 
is 
resistance
foucault
's 
point 
is 
simply 
that 
there 
is 
no 
single 
locus 
of 
great 
refusal
no 
soul 
of 
revolt
source 
of 
all 
rebellions
or 
pure 
law 
of 
the 
revolutionary
EOS
resistance 
does 
not 
operate 
outside 
power
nor 
is 
it 
necessarily 
produced 
oppositionally
it 
is 
imbricated 
within 
it
the 
irregular 
term 
that 
consistently 
disturbs 
it
rebounds 
upon 
it
and 
which 
on 
occasions 
can 
be 
manipulated 
so 
as 
to 
rupture 
it 
altogether
EOS
just 
as 
the 
network 
of 
power 
relations 
ends 
by 
forming 
a 
dense 
web 
that 
passes 
through 
apparatuses 
and 
institutions
without 
being 
exactly 
localized 
in 
them
so 
too 
the 
swarm 
of 
points 
of 
resistance 
traverses 
social 
stratifications 
and 
individual 
unities
EOS
and 
it 
is 
doubtless 
the 
strategic 
codification 
of 
these 
points 
of 
resistance 
that 
makes 
a 
revolution 
possible
somewhat 
similar 
to 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
state 
relies 
on 
the 
institutional 
integration 
of 
power 
relationships
EOS
it 
is 
in 
this 
way 
that 
foucault 
can 
return 
to 
the 
possibility 
of 
doing 
historical 
work 
that 
has 
political 
force 
through 
his 
notion 
of 
genealogy
which 
means
as 
he 
puts 
it
that 
i 
begin 
my 
analysis 
from 
a 
question 
posed 
in 
the 
present
EOS
the 
question 
enables 
the 
tactical 
use 
of 
historical 
knowledge 
in 
contemporary 
political 
situations 
which 
necessitate 
the 
posing 
of 
the 
question 
with 
which 
genealogy 
begins
EOS
such 
politics 
stress 
the 
local 
or 
the 
specific 
without 
assuming 
that 
they 
constitute 
the 
starting 
point 
for 
a 
global 
hegemony 
into 
which 
they 
will 
be 
subsumed
EOS
foucault 
does 
not 
aim 
to 
produce 
a
politics 
any 
more 
than 
a
history
EOS
it 
is 
this 
factor 
which
perhaps 
above 
all
has 
enabled 
the 
critical 
use 
of 
foucault
's 
analyses 
of 
power 
in 
demarcated 
areas 
of 
analysis
EOS
ironically
foucault
's 
most 
problematic 
theory
has 
generated 
the 
most 
successful 
and 
probing 
historical 
work 
among 
his 
followers
EOS
vii 
coda
the 
new 
historicism
EOS
the 
relation 
of 
foucault
's 
politics 
to 
history 
leads 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
tactical 
use 
of 
foucault 
himself 
in 
current 
forms 
of 
criticism
in 
addition 
to 
his 
extensive 
use 
by 
historians 
and 
sociologists
he 
is 
also 
associated 
with 
those 
movements 
that 
have 
become 
known 
as 
new 
historicism
and 
cultural 
materialism
EOS
the 
former 
is 
identified 
closely 
with 
foucault
while 
the 
latter 
owes 
its 
allegiance 
to 
raymond 
williams
and 
really 
only 
amounts 
to 
a 
way 
of 
describing 
british 
ex-marxists
EOS
new 
historicism 
is 
most 
concerned 
with 
the 
late 
foucault
in 
particular 
with 
representations 
and 
mechanisms 
of 
power
the 
means 
through 
which 
cultural 
artefacts 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
be 
not 
passive 
reflectors 
of 
the 
history 
of 
their 
time 
but 
active 
producers 
of 
it
EOS
this 
charting 
of 
the 
circulating 
relations 
between 
aesthetic 
and 
other 
forms 
of 
production 
works 
best 
in 
those 
historical 
periods
such 
as 
the 
renaissance
where 
there 
was 
no 
modern 
concept 
of 
literature
thus 
allowing 
literary 
texts 
to 
be 
mapped 
against 
the 
political 
and 
other 
discourses 
of 
which 
they 
formed 
a 
part
EOS
new 
historicism 
emphasizes 
the 
way 
in 
which 
certain 
rituals 
and 
practices
for 
example 
of 
kingship
are 
equally 
a 
part 
of 
the 
processes 
and 
representation 
of 
power 
whether 
at 
a 
beheading
a 
masque 
or 
in 
a 
poem
EOS
at 
the 
same 
time
it 
can 
also 
bring 
out 
the 
complex 
ways 
in 
which 
such 
forms 
of 
power 
also 
produce 
their 
own 
forms 
of 
resistance
as 
critics 
like 
stephen 
greenblatt 
demonstrate
these 
are 
not 
separable 
processes 
but 
are 
simultaneous 
effects 
of 
power
EOS
the 
illustration 
of 
such 
a 
double 
logic 
working 
at 
a 
textual 
level 
often 
comes 
to 
seem 
remarkably 
close 
to 
a 
deconstructive 
analysis
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
derrida 
or 
de 
man 
could 
be 
said 
to 
be 
deconstructing 
received 
readings 
that 
have 
institutional 
purchase
so 
the 
new 
historicists 
shift 
our 
understanding 
of 
institutionalized 
historical 
accounts
EOS
however
the 
very 
historical 
focus 
poses 
the 
problem 
of 
agency 
and 
containment 
in 
a 
more 
immediate 
way 
that 
demonstrates 
some 
of 
the 
dilemmas 
that 
follow 
from 
foucault
's 
genealogical 
history
EOS
the 
real 
difficulty
as 
greenblatt 
shows
is 
what 
status 
can 
be 
accorded 
the 
category 
of 
subversion 
or 
resistance
what 
is 
the 
historical 
status 
of 
the 
subversive
elements 
of 
a 
text
EOS
if 
the 
process 
of 
the 
construction 
of 
knowledge 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
work 
against 
itself
this 
can 
operate 
because 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
dominant 
order 
are 
not 
in 
fact 
threatened 
by 
alternatives 
which
with 
hindsight
may 
appear 
radical 
to 
us 
now
EOS
as 
the 
cultural 
materialists 
concede
subversive 
thoughts 
are 
not 
subversive 
until 
they 
become 
a 
practice
EOS
can 
they 
be 
shown 
to 
have 
had 
historical 
effects
EOS
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
a 
radical 
politics
the 
onus 
on 
the 
critic
therefore
is 
to 
show 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
such 
subversions 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
have 
produced 
specific 
instances 
of 
change
EOS
correspondingly
as 
greenblatt 
argues
renaissance 
ideas 
which 
might 
be 
subversive 
today 
are 
ignored 
in 
favour 
of
radical
ideas 
which 
seem 
to 
echo 
our 
own
EOS
both 
groups 
follow 
foucault 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
neither 
propose
nor 
utilize
a 
general 
theory 
of 
history 
as 
such
but 
unlike 
foucault 
they 
simply 
tend 
to 
shelve 
the 
whole 
problem 
so 
as 
to 
avoid 
its 
theoretical 
difficulties
EOS
so
despite 
the 
lukÃ¡csian 
resonance 
of 
its 
name
new 
historicism 
abandons 
both 
the 
notion 
of 
history 
as 
a 
readable 
background 
to 
literary 
texts
and 
the 
marxist 
dependency 
on 
reflection
in 
its 
effort 
to 
recontextualize 
literary 
texts 
in 
a 
more 
immediate 
way 
with 
other 
forms 
of 
social 
production
EOS
for 
their 
part
the 
british 
cultural 
materialists 
quickly 
adopted 
a 
name 
which 
tactfully 
removes 
the 
suggestion 
of 
marxism 
as 
such
EOS
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
present 
discussion 
of 
history
moreover
it 
is 
highly 
significant 
that 
traditional 
historical 
materialism
has 
been 
jettisoned 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
anthropological 
cultural 
materialism
EOS
the 
cultural 
materialists 
abandon 
the 
traditional 
marxist 
use 
of 
history 
as 
a 
ground 
for 
truth 
in 
favour 
of 
bringing 
history 
into 
the 
present 
day 
in 
order 
to 
intervene 
in 
their 
own 
institutional 
and 
academic 
political 
context
EOS
in 
this 
case 
it 
becomes 
less 
a 
matter 
of 
addressing 
contemporary 
political 
problems 
than 
of 
resisting 
institutional 
power
namely 
those 
critical 
readings 
which 
have 
recently 
claimed 
cultural 
hegemony
and 
of 
providing 
instead 
alternative 
accounts 
which 
insist 
on 
heterogeneity 
and 
resistance 
in 
historical 
texts
EOS
an 
identification 
is 
then 
implicitly 
or 
explicitly 
made 
with 
parallel 
forms 
of 
political 
struggle 
in 
our 
own 
day
EOS
in 
other 
words
where 
yesterday
's 
historian 
looked 
for 
the 
history 
of 
an 
oppressed 
working 
class
today
's 
historian 
looks 
for 
marginalized 
groups
and 
those 
who 
have 
transgressed 
social 
norms
EOS
whether 
they 
actually 
were 
subversive 
becomes 
irrelevant 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
can 
now 
be 
retrieved 
to 
offer 
a 
potential 
that 
has 
a 
contemporary
that 
is 
twentieth-century
political 
relevance
EOS
to 
this 
extent 
we 
could 
say 
that 
the 
cultural 
materialists 
re-assert 
a 
form 
of 
reflection 
theory
where 
history 
has 
become 
a 
mirror 
in 
which 
contemporary 
political 
priorities 
have 
been 
substituted 
for 
the 
former 
certain 
ground 
of 
marxist 
analysis
EOS
the 
cultural 
materialists 
are 
inclined 
to 
separate 
the 
self-contradictory 
differences 
isolated 
by 
the 
new 
historicists 
into 
a 
more 
conventional 
political 
paradigm 
of 
opposing 
classes
of 
hegemony 
and 
subversion
EOS
similarly
though 
foucault 
is 
often 
invoked
there 
is 
a 
marked 
tendency 
to 
continue 
to 
utilize 
theoretical 
categories 
such 
as 
ideology
consciousness 
and 
the 
subject
EOS
here 
it 
is 
salutary 
to 
recall 
foucault
's 
scepticism 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
perilous 
ease
with 
which 
politics 
quickly 
assumes 
positions 
that 
provide 
intellectual 
guarantees 
rather 
than 
specific 
analyses 
of 
particular 
relations 
or 
transformations
he 
reacts 
in 
the 
same 
way 
to 
political 
analogies
and 
correspondences
or 
to 
hasty 
links 
with 
current 
political 
practices
EOS
to 
the 
last
foucault 
himself 
remained 
suspicious 
of 
any 
progressive 
politics
if 
that 
meant 
that 
it 
continued 
to 
be 
linked 
to 
a 
hidden
meaning
origin
or 
the 
subject
EOS
but 
if 
the 
cultural 
materialists
unlike 
the 
more 
fastidious 
new 
historicists
cheerfully 
ignore 
the 
theoretical 
consequences 
of 
foucault
's 
work 
for 
many 
marxist 
concepts
in 
other 
ways 
they 
are 
closer 
to 
him  
insofar 
as 
they 
make 
clear 
in 
their 
work 
their 
own 
political 
priorities 
and 
commitments
EOS
nevertheless 
it 
is 
worth 
recalling 
that 
foucault 
never 
starts 
at 
the 
political
but 
rather 
begins 
with 
a 
contemporary 
problem 
and 
then 
addresses 
questions 
to 
politics 
about 
it
EOS
he 
argues 
that 
intellectual 
work 
need 
not 
always 
be 
measured 
against 
immediate 
political 
ends
rather 
the 
question 
to 
ask 
is 
what 
project 
is 
it 
undertaking
what 
problem 
is 
it 
analysing
EOS
it 
should 
always 
be 
possible 
for 
the 
intellectual 
to 
justify 
and 
to 
show 
the 
grounds 
on 
which 
any 
particular 
activity 
has 
been 
constituted
EOS
at 
the 
same 
time
it 
is 
too 
easy 
to 
condemn 
certain 
forms 
of 
work 
for 
being 
apolitical 
simply 
because 
they 
do 
not 
correspond 
to 
a 
certain 
paradigm 
of 
immediate 
political 
effectivity
EOS
political 
interventions 
can 
also 
work 
according 
to 
different 
time 
scales
EOS
but 
if 
the 
cultural 
materialists 
tend 
to 
place 
a 
politics 
rather 
than 
a 
problem 
as 
the 
starting 
point 
of 
their 
enquiry
they 
do 
emphasize 
the 
deployment 
of 
specialized 
knowledges 
in 
the 
service 
of 
the 
popular 
political 
struggles 
of 
today
EOS
this 
suggests 
a 
closeness 
to 
foucault
's 
notion 
of 
genealogy 
that 
the 
more 
strictly 
academic 
new 
historicists
whose 
own 
politics 
remain 
more 
carefully 
hidden
ignore
EOS
